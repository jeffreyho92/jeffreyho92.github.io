            <blockquote>
<p>Occam’s Razor - William of Ockham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Occam’s Razor is a mental model, problem-solving principle, to solve problems more quickly and efficiently. Explain in a nutshell, the simplest solution is often the best solution. When the thing can be simple, don’t make it complicated. When the complex solution and simple solution both work equally, we should choose the simple solution. The simpler a theory is, the more easily it can be verified. The simpler a solution is, the more easily it can be executed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. - Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, we want to implement a solution that can solve a lot of problems or issues. We want to put all the things that we have into one solution to prove that what we can do, but this will make things more complicated.  We try to create one method that can solve everything. However, this will make things complicated to understand, bring more mistakes to occur, and it is unlikely to lead to a manageable prediction.</p>
<p>A Mental model works best for making initial conclusions before the full information of the problem can be collected. We can have this mental model as a tool in our mental toolbox to give an immediate response when something happens.</p>
<p>Simple is as simple does, we can choose the easiest solution to get thing done. It is better than stuck in a complex solution and do nothing. You have got to see the forest before you can see the trees. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, if the complex solution does a better job than the simple solution, then we should pick the complex one. And making it too simple might not only be impracticable to solve the issue. Occam’s razor is not intended as a replacement for critical thinking. It is just a tool to help make that thinking more effective.</p>

<p>When I look at people who hustle into something, work for his own business, I felt like if I got the chance to work on my own business, I will be very hard working too. However, how to get the chance is a big question for me. Most of the people have this feeling in their life too, we always waiting for someone to provide us the opportunity to spend time and hustle into something.</p>
<p>Refer to those articles that I read, and do some study on it, they always talk about some common points. If you want to master a skill, you have to understand it, it takes practice, time, and persistence. Ask yourself, who is the leader in the industry that is absolutely crushing it, who is the icon in that specific field, who is the first person that you recall in your mind. We can do some research on what makes them successful, what skills are required to achieve your target. Map out the list of things that you would like to implement and start practicing.</p>
<p>We should start with setting an intention, identify what skillset needs to learn, then comes practice, then comes failing, then comes learning, then it is a habit and becomes a part of you. Consistency is the key, consistency leads to habits. This learning process is a formula that we can implement in almost everything. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives. It’s what we do consistently. - Anthony Robbins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remind ourselves, if you wait to be ready, you will be waiting forever. Take the first step to get started is more important than waiting for the perfect time to start.</p>

            <p>Mental Model represents how things work, or an explanation of a person’s thinking process. Our thinking quality is based on the models in the brain, and our brain will automatically trigger different thinking models in different situations. The more models you have, the bigger your toolbox will be, and you will be able to look at the same thing with different thinking models and different perspectives.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Inversion<br>Its origins can be found in the word “invert”, which is simply means “turn upside down”. Normally, when we want to make a good impression, we will think about doing something good to prove ourselves, but we should think about what bad things we should not be done. It can also be like rather than thinking about what you want, consider what you’d like to avoid. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Second-order thinking<br>Every action has a consequence and further consequences, it like a chain, connecting every action or circumstance. These are called second-order effects. In this model of thinking, we can think about the chained effect that will happen with all the actions we take, to avoid potentially making a bad decision. Second-order thinking enables us to discover the long-term result of our actions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pareto Principle<br>Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, often happens in our world, but we are not aware of it. The Pareto Principle specifies that for many results, 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. To put it simply, 80% of the result we got came from 20% of our hard work, which means that we should use 20% of our time to focus on the most important thing that can bring us 80% of a good result. Accept imperfection, and stop being a perfectionist.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A mental model is a very good tool which can help us make better decisions in our life. However, it is not easily accessible but once we start using it, we will implement it on a daily basis in almost everything.</p>

            <p>If let me think about the busiest person in the world, I immediately think of Elon Musk. How he can get so many things done every single day 24/7. He could be the Busyman in the business world, or whatever you name it. He managing Teala, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and the list keep going. Those companies he is working on that all changing the course of humanity. Even managing just one of those would be one hell of a project, every day dealing with uncertainty. I mean, with SpaceX alone he is trying to get us to Mars, this is insane.</p>
<p>Therefore, what does Elon Musk do differently from most other people, that makes him so extremely productive, get so many things done in all different area. Well, I think one thing is very clear, he is big on prioritization. He once said, “Focus on signal over noise. Don’t waste time on stuff that doesn’t actually make things better.” This sounds like a simple idea that everyone was known, but it is not easy to apply in our daily tasks. We always get disturbed by urgent things, even though that is not really urgent. </p>
<p>By considering reducing the things that don’t matter (much), he frees up his limited time and energy for the things that do matter, and that is something we should all learn from him and apply in our daily jobs. First thing first and get things done.</p>
<p>When we prioritize the most valuable tasks over all the ‘busywork’ tasks, that is when we effectively improve our productivity. That is how we will be able to achieve much more in much less time. Everyone has the same amount of time, 24 hours per day, get more done in less time is the key.</p>

            <p>It is common to hear the advice that people should take some risk and uncertainty if they want to be successful. Risk can separate into two different types, calculated risk, and non-calculated risk. I think knowing what you do and taking a risk with knowledge is calculated risk. When you have the knowledge of the things you are doing, you can handle the uncertainty, you can calculate the risk.</p>
<p>However, does risk-taking can lead to success or it is essential to be successful? For me, the answer depends on several factors, different people doing the same thing can lead to a different result. Successful people tend to take risks in ways that limit their potential losses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entrepreneurs are not risk takers. They are calculated risk takers. - Leonard C. Green</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The difference between risk-takers and calculated risk-takers is the difference between failure and success,” Green said. To be honest, this ideal looks like a survivorship bias, when the risk-taker becomes successful, we will think this is a good risk to take, but when the risk-taker becomes a failure, we will think this is a bad risk. In order to avoid survivorship bias, we need to look at the same thing in different ways and different perspectives. Take some time to study to get knowledge, we should look at the failure case, it is way more important than look at the success case. When we have the knowledge, we know how to play the game and applying some strategies.</p>
<p>Risk-taking does have some relative with success, but there are too many complicated factors to say that taking the risk will increase your chances to become successful. Even though those successful people also need to find ways to mitigate damage and lower the risks they take.</p>

            <p>When you think about how you will become in the future, who you will be in the future, and you look at your present and future selves as two different people. What you need to do to become the person you desire to be, the things that you doing now will benefit your future self. This is an important question that we need to ask ourselves, it is essential for our self-growth and become a better person.</p>
<p>Visualize about the future negative consequences that your future self will experience, what skill is required to overcome these negative moments, it can be a positive mindset or mentally strong heart, experiencing more things will make us stronger. Keep trying new things and learn from it is the key, the more you know the more you realize you don’t know. Go through all the things that happened in our life, good things or bad things all are valuable. Taking responsibility when you screw up, admit our mistake is the first step to conquer it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that everything is a case study. Think about what it is a case of and what principles apply. - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Change only comes from taking action not just knowing about it. Every time we realize we need to do something for our future self, we need to take immediate action on it, I know sometimes it can be tough though.</p>
<p>The way you do anything is the way you do everything, we should start from a very tiny step on small things that can keep improving ourselves, it could be just a 5 mins exercise every day, but it will make a big impact in our life. Start building a new habit for future self, give them a healthy life, they will be grateful for us in taking these minor actions.</p>

            <p>Whenever something bad happened, it may make someone worst or there could be an opportunity for someone to get better. Everything has two sides, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Crisis entails opportunities, we should try to look at the other side to avoid bias, though it is not easy but doable.</p>
<p>During this pandemic, a lot of people start doing digital marketing, they saw other people are doing something, so they also want to follow the trend, but this fall into the herd mentality, people can be influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most adaptable to change. - Charles Darwin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should we follow other people doing the same things to avoid falling behind, or should we accommodate ourselves to adopt the new changes in the environment, I prefer the second one. When we follow the trend, doing the same things as other people doing, we are stuck in the 80% crowd, we can’t stand out in this situation. </p>
<p>The other option is don’t follow other people but improve ourselves to stay in the game, learning new skills that essential to survive in the environment. I think this is better than following other people back since we are growing with new experiences and it doesn’t hurt to trying new things. Even though step out of our comfort zone and overcome the challenges in a new environment is not easy, we are taking a risk and opening ourselves up to the possibility of stress, it will be tough but it is worth spending effort on it.</p>
<p>Even if I fail now, the skills I have acquiring will be valuable in the future, it will become my weapon to fight the next challenges.</p>

            <p>Sometimes we thought we have to be knowledgeable to become successful, but in fact, not all the professors or scientists they can achieve success in life, even though they study a lot. Sometimes we thought we need to be hardworking to become successful but in fact, most of the foreign workers can’t achieve success in life, even though they are very hardworking on their work.</p>
<p>When I look at a successful person who has some disadvantages, I’m thinking about how he or she can be successful with such defeats. They could be being rude or be emotional with someone, how they can achieve success with doing such bad things, why we being a good person but can’t achieve something in our life. Though I still suffering in this thinking, but I realized that no one is saying that being a good person definitely can be a success in life. We still need to put hard work on something that we really desired to achieve, being a good person is just a choice as a human, although it’s not easy being kind all the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real test is being kind to unkind people. - Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Successful people can be unkind people. Nobody is perfect, people can be successful in their careers but fail in personal life, people can be kind in their family but doesn’t look successful in other people’s perspectives.</p>
<p>Good person won’t necessarily to become successful. I think the point here is not about being a good person or a bad person. The point here is how we determine success, it could be a different thing in different people’s life. However, keep improving ourselves to become better is essential to become successful, nobody is keeping the worst to achieve success. Fortunately, life is not fair but it is still good.</p>

            <p>Everyone has opinions, either opinion from you to other people’s things, or opinions from other people that give you, it can be good or bad, neither all. Dealing with other people’s opinions can be tough since you don’t know that is good or bad for you, people may think it is good maybe it works for them, but actually, it can be bad for you.</p>
<p>When you dealing with the opinion that you don’t agree with and the person insists on giving you his opinion and want you to make a decision on it. At this point, opinion becomes troublesome, how to decline people’s opinion is like a martial art. We can’t straightaway reject the opinion, we need to handle it without affecting our relationship, we need to articulate our thoughts more clearly, and don’t be emotional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t treat all opinions as equally valuable - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the opinion that works on other people but may not works on our own. Learning how to recognize a good opinion it takes time to gain from experiences but it is an essential skill in our life. When we took the opinion and realized it is bad for us, the first time what we need to do is make a reflection on it, instead of blaming other people.</p>
<p>Don’t argue for other people’s opinions. Don’t argue for your own. When you make a mistake, admit it, correct it, and learn from it. We should get improve from other people’s opinions, rather than become worst from it. We can don’t follow the opinion if we thought it is not useful for us, it depends on different situations and the way you see it through.</p>
<p>Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. The opinion is thought from other people but implements on our own. We should take responsibility for it, think about the opinion with our personal situation, instead of following blindly. Don’t be in blind faith and avoid the herding effect.</p>

            <p>People keep moving forward with gaining new knowledge. Learning is the very first step of change, learning is just a small part of the puzzle, but it’s the most important part. Sometimes we feel hard to take the step out due to procrastination or lack of intention, or maybe we read it once then we thought we had learned about it, but this is not true.</p>
<p>As Alvin Toffler mentioned in his book, the 21st-century learning process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learn -&gt; Unlearn -&gt; Re-learn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learn: Getting the new things that we had never seen or known before, and take it as our knowledge.<br>Unlearn: After we learn the knowledge, it is open to objection. We should do some reflection on it, is it matching with our faith, should we agree with that point of view, we can be opposed to it.<br>Re-learn: After the reflection process, we re-learn the knowledge and come out with our own beliefs. This is such an important process that we can learn the knowledge that suite our past and future.</p>
<p>As Chris Do mention in his video, this is the new generation of the education process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Self-learning -&gt; Critical thinking -&gt; Articulation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self-learning: We can learn what we wanted to learn through searching Google, read a book, join an online course, subscript MOOC, or even learn from a stranger.<br>Critical thinking: After we learn the new thing, we start a debate on it, think about how it is work, and is it a reliable knowledge, and how we can use it in our own.<br>Articulation: After we process the new learning to become our knowledge, we share it with people around us, it can be written in a post or article, repeat thinking about the knowledge. We should speak out loud for sharing and it can strengthen our memory.</p>
<p>Learning is from an input, and processing becomes an output, we consume the knowledge we learn, reflect on it, and implement it in our life.</p>

            <p>Everyone has opinions, either opinion from you to other people’s things, or opinions from other people that give you, it can be good or bad, neither all. Dealing with other people’s opinions can be tough since you don’t know that is good or bad for you, people may think it is good maybe it works for them, but actually, it can be bad for you.</p>
<p>When you dealing with the opinion that you don’t agree with and the person insists on giving you his opinion and want you to make a decision on it. At this point, opinion becomes troublesome, how to decline people’s opinion is like a martial art. We can’t straightaway reject the opinion, we need to handle it without affecting our relationship, we need to articulate our thoughts more clearly, and don’t be emotional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t treat all opinions as equally valuable - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the opinion that works on other people but may not works on our own. Learning how to recognize a good opinion it takes time to gain from experiences but it is an essential skill in our life. When we took the opinion and realized it is bad for us, the first time what we need to do is make a reflection on it, instead of blaming other people.</p>
<p>Don’t argue for other people’s opinions. Don’t argue for your own. When you make a mistake, admit it, correct it, and learn from it. We should get improve from other people’s opinions, rather than become worst from it. We can don’t follow the opinion if we thought it is not useful for us, it depends on different situations and the way you see it through.</p>
<p>Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. The opinion is thought from other people but implements on our own. We should take responsibility for it, think about the opinion with our personal situation, instead of following blindly. Don’t be in blind faith and avoid the herding effect.</p>

            <p>People keep moving forward with gaining new knowledge. Learning is the very first step of change, learning is just a small part of the puzzle, but it’s the most important part. Sometimes we feel hard to take the step out due to procrastination or lack of intention, or maybe we read it once then we thought we had learned about it, but this is not true.</p>
<p>As Alvin Toffler mentioned in his book, the 21st-century learning process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learn -&gt; Unlearn -&gt; Re-learn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learn: Getting the new things that we had never seen or known before, and take it as our knowledge.<br>Unlearn: After we learn the knowledge, it is open to objection. We should do some reflection on it, is it matching with our faith, should we agree with that point of view, we can be opposed to it.<br>Re-learn: After the reflection process, we re-learn the knowledge and come out with our own beliefs. This is such an important process that we can learn the knowledge that suite our past and future.</p>
<p>As Chris Do mention in his video, this is the new generation of the education process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Self-learning -&gt; Critical thinking -&gt; Articulation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self-learning: We can learn what we wanted to learn through searching Google, read a book, join an online course, subscript MOOC, or even learn from a stranger.<br>Critical thinking: After we learn the new thing, we start a debate on it, think about how it is work, and is it a reliable knowledge, and how we can use it in our own.<br>Articulation: After we process the new learning to become our knowledge, we share it with people around us, it can be written in a post or article, repeat thinking about the knowledge. We should speak out loud for sharing and it can strengthen our memory.</p>
<p>Learning is from an input, and processing becomes an output, we consume the knowledge we learn, reflect on it, and implement it in our life.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, we are used to enjoying doing small things and make it looks perfect since it is easy to get done and we can get the result response immediately, though, it is not interesting. People like to do things that are able to get immediate responses and feel easy to do it, like reply email or doing a small task, it lets us feel that we are doing something. However, it didn’t bring much value to our time.</p>
<p>Big things are something that not easy to achieve, it requires us to give hard work on it, and takes time to work on it to get some outcomes. Most of the time, we are procrastinating to work on the big things since it needs more effort, more focus, and consume more time on it. However, it will bring a huge effect on our life when we achieve it, it worth our time to spend on it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s more important to do big things well than to do small things perfectly. - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get things done and make life easy. I’m still learning to make the small things done but not make it perfect. Sometimes, when I doing the small things, I like to make it perfect and waste a lot of time in the details. Nevertheless, stop being a perfectionist is a good achievement.</p>
<p>Begin with the end in mind, Stephen Covey wrote in his book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. When we get started to do something, we can make a clear vision of the desired direction and destination, imaging the thing that had been completed, and how will it looks like. This action can give us some motivation to work on it and make things happen, done lately is better than no progress.</p>
<p>Value your time and waste your time in something that makes values in your life.</p>

            <p>Every human being has strengths and weaknesses, we should focus on our strengths or fix the weaknesses, this is a deep question in our life. Based-on the wood barrel theory, the shortest plank is way more important than the longest plank, you can’t bring more water with longer plank cause water will lacking from the shortest plank, this reflects as a weak point in a person. In most of the case, we can do a lot with our strengths but sometimes we will fail in our weaknesses. Thus, we have to admit it, highlighting them, diagnosing them, thinking about what should be done differently in the future, in order to fix the weaknesses.</p>
<p>You may feel that recognizing our weak point is not that easy process, we need to do the reflection on the mistake we did, understand the root cause, and admit on it. Finding out that you are wrong is even more valuable than being right because you are learning, you are fixing the shorter plank of your life.</p>
<p>Indeep, sometimes we had identified our weak point but we don’t know how to solve it, it will bring more stress altogether. However, when we understand the problem we have, we can look into it more details, start researching to find out the solution, read something that can enhance our mindset. When you realized you don’t know, means that you already know.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet fixing unacceptable problems is actually a lot easier than not fixing them, because not fixing them will make you miserable. - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly believe that we need to fix our weaknesses, try to improve a little bit on it and life will be better when we conquer it. Even though we can’t overcome our weak point in some cases, at least we can avoid it when we know what it is and do more things to cover it, it will be more beneficial than knowing nothing about it.</p>

            <p>I was often thinking about how to be a success in my career and what I need to do to achieve it. This question brings along with another question, what is a successful career and how can we measure it. I have a faith that as long as I keep learning and improving, I am in the direction of the place or position that I thought is a successful career. </p>
<p>However, sometimes I saw people around me who had been done some achievements or make more money than me at the same age, I just concerning how they can do it and what skill or attribute that requires for it. The more I think the more I realized that the important point is in their thinking patterns, they always think about what people want, not what they want to give. When we try to understand people and studying what is helpful for people, we provide our value to people and get success from it. </p>

<p>They simply engaged in the work that they were doing, produced what society wanted, and got rich doing it. - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ray Dalio wrote in his book, Principles, identify a project you will be facing in the near future and apply the principles of mental creation write down the results you desire, and what steps will lead to those results.</p>
<p>The direction of our target and knowing what we want is the most important things and it is essential for all of us. If we want to become a millionaire, we need to think like a millionaire and act like them so as to become one of them. I need to be clear about my goals, focus on the things I desire, and what is the required ability to achieve it. It will be a long journey but I feel very interested in it like an adventure.</p>

            <p>Every time I feel like want to prepare everything before getting started, doing a lot of research and planning, but sometimes not even start to do it. We are enjoying the moment of preparing, planning, imaging, getting ready, but we felt uninterested when start doing it.</p>
<p>Sometimes we are looking for a good plan to get ready, wanted to get a perfect job done, imaging the plan a hundred times in mind, but plan can’t keep up with changes. Sometimes experiences and the ability to deal with changes are more important than a perfect plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Principles. You don’t have to know everything to get what you want. You just have to be honest with yourself about what you don’t know and know who to ask for help. - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think doing while learning is better than learning for doing. To be honest, I prefer practical knowledge compare with theoretical knowledge, I’m a practical person, I learned something from doing it not studying it, I felt like I can understand more in real-life hands-on experiences, instead of the theory of knowledge that learn from books. </p>
<p>Recognize the power of knowing how to deal with not knowing. The fast learner is better than a smart person. The fast learner can deal with a different situation and learn a new skill to overcome it. The smart person will fail when the situation is not good for him when he can’t deal with it, he does nothing.</p>
<p>Understand that the ability to deal with not knowing is for more powerful than knowing. We should not feel shame when we are not a smart person, we should feel shame when we can’t learn something from it and improve it, even though just a little bit. When we know the problem, we already solved half of the problem. </p>

            <p>Looking at feeling from a different angle and a different perspective can feel differently. Every feeling can be good or bad, especially for Pain, it depends on how you treat it.</p>
<p>Bad pain; allow pain to stand in the way of your progress, it makes you fail.<br>Good pain; understand how to manage the pain to produce progress with it.</p>
<p>Sometime happened something bad to you, you feel pain and uncomfortable, but we can see it as an experience. Sometimes you get criticism from people around you, you feel pain and hurt, but we can see it as an enlightened. Sometimes you face a failure, you feel pain and disappointment, but we can see it as an adventure. Those bad things make you feel pain but if you don’t learn from it, it will be more painful.</p>
<p>Instead of avoiding the pain to happen, we should focus on the reflection when the pain happened, we can think about how and why the things happen, swift to a different perspective, and learn from the pain.</p>
<p>Ray Dalio once wrote in his book Principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pain + Reflection = Progress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most learning comes from making mistakes and experiencing the pain of them. Looks into the pain is not easy, sometimes it is violated with our self-esteem, struggling with acceptance, and admit it is our false. </p>
<p>When you meet resistance, push through the pain of facing your problem, knowing you will end up in a much better place, it will bring you to overcome the resistance. Pain is like a wall that blocks us from moving forward and lets us feel safe behind it and stay in the comfort zone. Sometimes we need to be brave to pick it up and throw it behind.</p>
<p>Don’t waste the pain and make it worth to happen.</p>

            <p>A lot of people are scared about making mistakes, we thought a mistake is a bad thing that we need to avoid, but I think we should accept the mistake we made and learn from it, even though it’s not easy. Sometimes it’s very hard to admit the mistake we made in front of other people, it felt like we are telling people that we are not smart enough or we are stupid, but that’s not true. Some people admit the mistake and also learn from it, look into it, and avoid making it again. This time, a mistake became a good experience rather than a bad experience.</p>
<p>School learning overemphasizes the value of having the right answers and punishes the wrong answers, that’s why we terrified to do the odd thing and choose the safest way to avoid mistakes. The second option appears to be in flat contradiction of the first option, the safest way may not be the right way. Sometimes we need to do a mistake to get the right answer, a mistake can end up being the best decision you ever make, not making mistakes is the biggest mistake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The worst mistake is not facing up to mistakes - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michael Jordan, he became a champion and the greatest basketball player because he loved using his mistakes to improve himself instead of avoiding mistakes and do the normal things. Maybe we can’t become a legend like him, but we should learn from him, learn from our mistakes, and step up on it to go farther.</p>
<p>To think, how to sidestep mistakes and not doing anything, this will bring us nothing. Though, we should be careful and think deeply before we make a decision, although we can only know the outcome by doing it. Well, we may feel pain when making a mistake, but the regret of not doing it is more painful.</p>

            <p>Life keeps require us to make decisions, each decision is linked to the next decision. When we are in school, we make the decision that we want to study hard or play hard, it was linked to another decision after we graduated. If we choose to continue to study and go into college, we need to pick what course we want and make another decision again. If we choose to get a job, we have to think about what we can do and which field we want to work on, it requires another decision. Each decision is like a chain that links to the next opportunity and it is very hard to reverse back.</p>
<p>We aren’t born with the ability to make good decisions, but we can learn about it. Everyone starts from zero experience, no one had the knowledge. In the beginning, someone may have an unfair advantage like the environment they bornt, though. We will start with a lot of the decisions we made, no matter good or bad decisions. Whenever we realized we make a bad decision, we should accept the cause and effect, we shouldn’t blame on it and felt regret about the decision we made. I think this will waste the effort that we did for making the decision, it could be an important experience in our life, it could help us to avoid the next bad decision that could happen. </p>
<p>The quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we made. When something requires us to make a decision, we can pick the easiest option, and accept it to fall as commonplace. However, the easiest option may not be a good decision, we should try to execute a different decision, gain a different experience so that we can make a change in our life. </p>
<p>Fortune is grasped by our own hands, we can draft our life with unexpected results.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>A dream is just a dream. A goal is a dream with a plan and a deadline. - Harvey Mackay</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goal setting is such an important process to achieve your plan or target, it involves action plans and measurable targets, it can be used in your life or your career. A goal is like a compass, it is able to help you to stick to your plan and let you know where you are, it will bring you a clear image of your thought. </p>
<p>Sometimes we are seeking new things in our life, we wanted to do something that we thought is good for us, we want to change our life, leave the comfort zone though it is not easy. We can step out of the first step, think about what we want, and how to get it. We can set a goal and start to plan about it, take action, it will motivate us in the process. </p>
<p>Working and learning in the process of pursuing these goals, create an action plan for it. The action plan is what you need to do to achieve the goal you set, the requirement to get on your goal, and the difficult part to achieve it. Follow the plan and implement it step by step, bit by bit, this process can be very tough it depends on what you want. To keep in track of your plan and obtaining your goal,  you need to work on your plan consistently and get the result in the end. A lot of things that are not as a fast game, we are nothing working hard to get the things first but to keep the things lasting. Doing this over and over again is the personal evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Do the things simple, and repeat doing the simple things. Setting a goal is simple but important, we can have a clear image of what we want instead of doing everything that we think we should. Set a simple goal, get a hard result.</p>

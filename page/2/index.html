            <p>Every time I feel like want to prepare everything before getting started, doing a lot of research and planning, but sometimes not even start to do it. We are enjoying the moment of preparing, planning, imaging, getting ready, but we felt uninterested when start doing it.</p>
<p>Sometimes we are looking for a good plan to get ready, wanted to get a perfect job done, imaging the plan a hundred times in mind, but plan can’t keep up with changes. Sometimes experiences and the ability to deal with changes are more important than a perfect plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Principles. You don’t have to know everything to get what you want. You just have to be honest with yourself about what you don’t know and know who to ask for help. - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think doing while learning is better than learning for doing. To be honest, I prefer practical knowledge compare with theoretical knowledge, I’m a practical person, I learned something from doing it not studying it, I felt like I can understand more in real-life hands-on experiences, instead of the theory of knowledge that learn from books. </p>
<p>Recognize the power of knowing how to deal with not knowing. The fast learner is better than a smart person. The fast learner can deal with a different situation and learn a new skill to overcome it. The smart person will fail when the situation is not good for him when he can’t deal with it, he does nothing.</p>
<p>Understand that the ability to deal with not knowing is for more powerful than knowing. We should not feel shame when we are not a smart person, we should feel shame when we can’t learn something from it and improve it, even though just a little bit. When we know the problem, we already solved half of the problem. </p>

            <p>Looking at feeling from a different angle and a different perspective can feel differently. Every feeling can be good or bad, especially for Pain, it depends on how you treat it.</p>
<p>Bad pain; allow pain to stand in the way of your progress, it makes you fail.<br>Good pain; understand how to manage the pain to produce progress with it.</p>
<p>Sometime happened something bad to you, you feel pain and uncomfortable, but we can see it as an experience. Sometimes you get criticism from people around you, you feel pain and hurt, but we can see it as an enlightened. Sometimes you face a failure, you feel pain and disappointment, but we can see it as an adventure. Those bad things make you feel pain but if you don’t learn from it, it will be more painful.</p>
<p>Instead of avoiding the pain to happen, we should focus on the reflection when the pain happened, we can think about how and why the things happen, swift to a different perspective, and learn from the pain.</p>
<p>Ray Dalio once wrote in his book Principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pain + Reflection = Progress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most learning comes from making mistakes and experiencing the pain of them. Looks into the pain is not easy, sometimes it is violated with our self-esteem, struggling with acceptance, and admit it is our false. </p>
<p>When you meet resistance, push through the pain of facing your problem, knowing you will end up in a much better place, it will bring you to overcome the resistance. Pain is like a wall that blocks us from moving forward and lets us feel safe behind it and stay in the comfort zone. Sometimes we need to be brave to pick it up and throw it behind.</p>
<p>Don’t waste the pain and make it worth to happen.</p>

            <p>A lot of people are scared about making mistakes, we thought a mistake is a bad thing that we need to avoid, but I think we should accept the mistake we made and learn from it, even though it’s not easy. Sometimes it’s very hard to admit the mistake we made in front of other people, it felt like we are telling people that we are not smart enough or we are stupid, but that’s not true. Some people admit the mistake and also learn from it, look into it, and avoid making it again. This time, a mistake became a good experience rather than a bad experience.</p>
<p>School learning overemphasizes the value of having the right answers and punishes the wrong answers, that’s why we terrified to do the odd thing and choose the safest way to avoid mistakes. The second option appears to be in flat contradiction of the first option, the safest way may not be the right way. Sometimes we need to do a mistake to get the right answer, a mistake can end up being the best decision you ever make, not making mistakes is the biggest mistake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The worst mistake is not facing up to mistakes - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michael Jordan, he became a champion and the greatest basketball player because he loved using his mistakes to improve himself instead of avoiding mistakes and do the normal things. Maybe we can’t become a legend like him, but we should learn from him, learn from our mistakes, and step up on it to go farther.</p>
<p>To think, how to sidestep mistakes and not doing anything, this will bring us nothing. Though, we should be careful and think deeply before we make a decision, although we can only know the outcome by doing it. Well, we may feel pain when making a mistake, but the regret of not doing it is more painful.</p>

            <p>Life keeps require us to make decisions, each decision is linked to the next decision. When we are in school, we make the decision that we want to study hard or play hard, it was linked to another decision after we graduated. If we choose to continue to study and go into college, we need to pick what course we want and make another decision again. If we choose to get a job, we have to think about what we can do and which field we want to work on, it requires another decision. Each decision is like a chain that links to the next opportunity and it is very hard to reverse back.</p>
<p>We aren’t born with the ability to make good decisions, but we can learn about it. Everyone starts from zero experience, no one had the knowledge. In the beginning, someone may have an unfair advantage like the environment they bornt, though. We will start with a lot of the decisions we made, no matter good or bad decisions. Whenever we realized we make a bad decision, we should accept the cause and effect, we shouldn’t blame on it and felt regret about the decision we made. I think this will waste the effort that we did for making the decision, it could be an important experience in our life, it could help us to avoid the next bad decision that could happen. </p>
<p>The quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we made. When something requires us to make a decision, we can pick the easiest option, and accept it to fall as commonplace. However, the easiest option may not be a good decision, we should try to execute a different decision, gain a different experience so that we can make a change in our life. </p>
<p>Fortune is grasped by our own hands, we can draft our life with unexpected results.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>A dream is just a dream. A goal is a dream with a plan and a deadline. - Harvey Mackay</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goal setting is such an important process to achieve your plan or target, it involves action plans and measurable targets, it can be used in your life or your career. A goal is like a compass, it is able to help you to stick to your plan and let you know where you are, it will bring you a clear image of your thought. </p>
<p>Sometimes we are seeking new things in our life, we wanted to do something that we thought is good for us, we want to change our life, leave the comfort zone though it is not easy. We can step out of the first step, think about what we want, and how to get it. We can set a goal and start to plan about it, take action, it will motivate us in the process. </p>
<p>Working and learning in the process of pursuing these goals, create an action plan for it. The action plan is what you need to do to achieve the goal you set, the requirement to get on your goal, and the difficult part to achieve it. Follow the plan and implement it step by step, bit by bit, this process can be very tough it depends on what you want. To keep in track of your plan and obtaining your goal,  you need to work on your plan consistently and get the result in the end. A lot of things that are not as a fast game, we are nothing working hard to get the things first but to keep the things lasting. Doing this over and over again is the personal evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Do the things simple, and repeat doing the simple things. Setting a goal is simple but important, we can have a clear image of what we want instead of doing everything that we think we should. Set a simple goal, get a hard result.</p>

            <p>I feel so glad that I’m an optimistic person and think positive, I always think the best thing will happen and I believe everything happens for a reason no matter it’s good or bad. </p>
<p>Human makes mistakes, some people don’t look at their mistake and blame to other things or person. But I think we need to learn from our mistakes and learn how to admit to it, this is not easy and we need to expose us to the feedback. Some people thought the mistake is bad, it discloses personal weaknesses and makes them look stupid. Though I think we need to prevent mistake but when it happens, we require to accept it and it will help us to recognize our weaknesses, this is essential for our learning.</p>
<p>Great people none of them were born great, they all made lots of mistakes and had lots of weaknesses. That great people become great by looking at their mistakes and weaknesses and figuring out how to get around them.</p>
<p>Mistake makes failure, our first impression when we face failure, we feel so bad and unsettling, we think why we are the only one who got it, why this happens to me, why I’m so unlucky. But we have got to think about why this bad thing happens, it may happen due to ourselves, not others. </p>
<p>If we learn from failure, we may successfully deal with the realities of life. Failure is like a stone, we can choose to throw away the stone, or use the stone to step-ups on it, then the bad thing will become a good thing. It is not easy to review our failure, recall all the mistakes we did, and make a reflection on it. In spite of it, if we can get this skill set, we can adapt to any environment, no matter how we are and where we are, we can become better and better.</p>

            <p>Back then in 2016, I was working in Panasonic Senai as a software engineer, I got an opportunity to travel to Japan with a business trip. At that time I have just working in Panasonic Senai around 9 months, and one of the departments in our company just setting up a new system developed by Panasonic Japan members. By chance, I had been assigned to maintain this system and handle future enhancement. In order to handover the system, Japan members requested I to travel to Tokyo to meet them and they will handover all the information related to this system to me.</p>
<p>This is my first-time travel to Japan and Tokyo, I felt very excited to visit Tokyo since it is a prosperous city and the top fashion culture in Asia. I did a lot of research about it and planned my travel schedule and those places I wanted to visits. This business trip is around 6 days and I need to work from 9 am to 5 pm, but I still able to travel around after work. I work with Japan members in the Panasonic Tokyo office, it is a sales distribution center, that’s why it allocated in the Tokyo city in a huge office building. </p>
<p>My department head was with me for the first two days on this business trip, he brought me to having dinner with Japan members after work. We went to have some drinks, it is a Japanese Beer Buffet with snacks. After that, he leaves me alone to work with Japan members.      He guild me to learn how to take the train to the office from the hotel that we stay in, but I was once get lost when I went off from the office to the hotel. I’m using GPS and Google Maps but I still can’t find the way to the hotel, luckily I asked a Japanese to guild me back, I took one hour lost and back to the hotel that only needs 10 mins journey.</p>
<p>The Japan member treated me very well, he brought me to travel around after work, he guild me on how to go to the place I wanted to visits. They also bought me some lunch since the living cost in Tokyo is very high, a meal costs around 35 Ringgit Malaysia, it is very expensive for me since I’m just a fresh graduate with a low salary at that moment.</p>
<p>This is a very special experience for me,  I felt that Japan is very big different compare with Malaysia, the culture and the society are very unique and attractive. I felt blessed to have this opportunity to travel to Tokyo Japan, thanks to my department head and the Japan members.</p>

            <p>Quality Control (QC) is a very important part of a manufacturing company, they have to ensure the products they produce have no issue and in good quality. When I working in Panasonic Senai, Quality Control is the most focused process along with the production since the vision of Panasonic is to produce the product that can be lasting a long period with good quality. When a customer reported a quality issue in a Panasonic product, we need to recall all the products produced in the same patch even the product was ship to oversea.</p>
<p>We do the Quality Control process starts from raw material, production line, finished goods, and packing before it ships to customers. These whole processes are running with some tools and managed in the system. When the raw material arrived in the store warehouse from vendors, QC members will go and take some raw materials as sampling for the Quality Control process, they doing this process with system control. The system will record down the material and quantity that being Quality Control process and reflect into stock quantity, this will help the store members to manage the stock and prevent stock missing or stock quantity not tally. </p>
<p>In the production line, we have some tools to test the functionality of the product, we use OCR with a high-quality camera to check the assemble process and installation process, this can prevent the human mistake like installing a part with the wrong direction. </p>
<p>During the packing process, production operators pack the completed product in a box with some user manual and some documentation. In order to prevent human mistakes like missing user manual with the packed box, we implement a system by the name of Weight Checker System. This system will pre-configured with the weight of the packed product and the allowed differences in milligrams, it will trigger an alert when the weight of the packed product is not in the range of the standard weight, it means something wrong in the packing.</p>
<p>This is a good opportunity for me to learn more about the business processes in a manufacturing company and the Quality Control is really important for a company, it can deploy a company if some bad thing happen.</p>

            <p>In Panasonic Senai, we have a department managing the raw material for the production lines, they control the material that needed in the production to ensure the production lines can run smoothly. They have to work with Store members to prepare the raw material followed by the production plan, all the material will move to the production warehouse from the Store warehouse.</p>
<p>Before production lines start running and produce finish goods, they follow the material listing to collect all the raw materials needed for the production, each product has at least 20 raw materials. They need to collect and count the material carefully since different material has a different quantity for each type of product, they need to follow the material listing and production plan and split it into multiple production lines. Sometimes there have some quality issues in the production line that running haft way, they need to stop the production and collect back all the raw material and put the balance back to the production warehouse. These business processes are involved in a lot of manual processes and it costs a lot of manpower. In order to enhance these processes, top management requested the IT department to implement a system to optimize it.</p>
<p>When our department working on this project, I had been assigned to join in and support the implementation. After we study and understand the whole process, we implemented some new processes for them to work with the system to reduce the workload and prevent human error, instead of doing everything in manual ways. They can download the enhanced material listing that auto-generate with production plans and production lines. We also implement the QR code system to help them to collect material and manage production warehouse. This system can reduce around 50% of the workload and prevent inventory discrepancies. They do the stock check with more efficiently and accurately, they increate the stock check routine to weekly from twice a month. However, in the beginning, we need to put a lot of effort to implement it, design the layout, printout the QR code, and allocate it one by one.</p>
<p>This is a huge change for them, they need to adapt to the new process and change their working habit, this is not easy for them since they are used to the old manual process, they need to be open-minded to accept the new things that can improve their workload.</p>

            <p>When I was working in Panasonic Senai, back than 2016, the production planning department is such a huge and complicated department around one hundred staff, they are managing production plans, raw material plans, delivery plans, shipment plans, and all the production products. The complicated part is they need to cooperate with multiple parties, members from other departments, and outside vendors, they need to ensure the production line can run smoothly. This business process runs a highly important part of a manufacturing company.</p>
<p>Everything starts from the Sales Order. They receive the Sales Order from Panasonic Japan with the target shipment date, normally they will receive the order 6 months in advance. They need to calculate the raw material from the required products to start planning the production. They contact the suppliers of the raw material and manage the estimated delivery date, so they can start planing the production line and arrange production shifts. After that, they need to work with the Logistics member for the shipment date and reply estimated arrived date to customers. </p>
<p>Plans always fall behind changes. Sometime the production plan will be affected by multiple issues such as delayed material delivery, production quality control issues, etc. They need to respond immediately and roll out a new production plan to prevent the delay of arriving in customers, like fire fighting. There are a lot of complicated processes and manual works.</p>
<p>In order to optimize the business process and prevent human error, we control most of the processes in our ERP system, SAP. Most of the documents will go through the system and connect with vendors and suppliers, but they still need to do human decisions like production planning and forecast. I had been assigned to create a system for them with the production forecast planning. This system will collect all the Sales Order and the raw material dataset to calculate and forecast the production plan. It also connects with the Inventory system to highlight the material shortage in a dashboard, so they can easy to monitor the raw material with the production plan.</p>
<p>I got this opportunity to study and understand the production business process, this is a rare experience for me and I can’t easily learn about it from other companies, this experience brings me forward in my career.</p>

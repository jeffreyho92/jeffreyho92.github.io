What you need to do to become the person you desire to be, the things that you doing now will benefit your future self. This is an important question that we need to ask ourselves, it is essential for our self-growth and become a better person.</p><p>Visualize about the future negative consequences that your future self will experience, what skill is required to overcome these negative moments, it can be a positive mindset or mentally strong heart, experiencing more things will make us stronger. Keep trying new things and learn from it is the key, the more you know the more you realize you don’t know. Go through all the things that happened in our life, good things or bad things all are valuable. Taking responsibility when you screw up, admit our mistake is the first step to conquer it.</p><blockquote><p>Remember that everything is a case study. Think about what it is a case of and what principles apply. - Ray Dalio</p></blockquote><p>Change only comes from taking action not just knowing about it. Every time we realize we need to do something for our future self, we need to take immediate action on it, I know sometimes it can be tough though.</p><p>The way you do anything is the way you do everything, we should start from a very tiny step on small things that can keep improving ourselves, it could be just a 5 mins exercise every day, but it will make a big impact in our life.

Everything has two sides, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Crisis entails opportunities, we should try to look at the other side to avoid bias, though it is not easy but doable.</p><p>During this pandemic, a lot of people start doing digital marketing, they saw other people are doing something, so they also want to follow the trend, but this fall into the herd mentality, people can be influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most adaptable to change. - Charles Darwin</p></blockquote><p>Should we follow other people doing the same things to avoid falling behind, or should we accommodate ourselves to adopt the new changes in the environment, I prefer the second one. When we follow the trend, doing the same things as other people doing, we are stuck in the 80% crowd, we can’t stand out in this situation. </p><p>The other option is don’t follow other people but improve ourselves to stay in the game, learning new skills that essential to survive in the environment. I think this is better than following other people back since we are growing with new experiences and it doesn’t hurt to trying new things. Even though step out of our comfort zone and overcome the challenges in a new environment is not easy, we are taking a risk and opening ourselves up to the possibility of stress, it will be tough but it is worth spending effort on it.</p><p>Even if I fail now, the skills I have acquiring will be valuable in the future, it will become my weapon to fight the next challenges.</p>]]></content>

Though I still suffering in this thinking, but I realized that no one is saying that being a good person definitely can be a success in life.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has opinions, either opinion from you to other people’s things, or opinions from other people that give you, it can be good or bad, neither all. Dealing with other people’s opinions can be tough since you don’t know that is good or bad for you, people may think it is good maybe it works for them, but actually, it can be bad for you.</p><p>When you dealing with the opinion that you don’t agree with and the person insists on giving you his opinion and want you to make a decision on it. At this point, opinion becomes troublesome, how to decline people’s opinion is like a martial art. We can’t straightaway reject the opinion, we need to handle it without affecting our relationship, we need to articulate our thoughts more clearly, and don’t be emotional.</p><blockquote><p>Don’t treat all opinions as equally valuable - Ray Dalio</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes the opinion that works on other people but may not works on our own. Learning how to recognize a good opinion it takes time to gain from experiences but it is an essential skill in our life. When we took the opinion and realized it is bad for us, the first time what we need to do is make a reflection on it, instead of blaming other people.</p><p>Don’t argue for other people’s opinions. Don’t argue for your own. When you make a mistake, admit it, correct it, and learn from it. We should get improve from other people’s opinions, rather than become worst from it. We can don’t follow the opinion if we thought it is not useful for us, it depends on different situations and the way you see it through.</p><p>Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. The opinion is thought from other people but implements on our own. We should take responsibility for it, think about the opinion with our personal situation, instead of following blindly. Don’t be in blind faith and avoid the herding effect.</p>]]></content>

Learning is the very first step of change, learning is just a small part of the puzzle, but it’s the most important part. Sometimes we feel hard to take the step out due to procrastination or lack of intention, or maybe we read it once then we thought we had learned about it, but this is not true.</p><p>As Alvin Toffler mentioned in his book, the 21st-century learning process:</p><blockquote><p>Learn -&gt; Unlearn -&gt; Re-learn</p></blockquote><p>Learn: Getting the new things that we had never seen or known before, and take it as our knowledge.<br>Unlearn: After we learn the knowledge, it is open to objection. We should do some reflection on it, is it matching with our faith, should we agree with that point of view, we can be opposed to it.<br>Re-learn: After the reflection process, we re-learn the knowledge and come out with our own beliefs. This is such an important process that we can learn the knowledge that suite our past and future.</p><p>As Chris Do mention in his video, this is the new generation of the education process:</p><blockquote><p>Self-learning -&gt; Critical thinking -&gt; Articulation</p></blockquote><p>Self-learning: We can learn what we wanted to learn through searching Google, read a book, join an online course, subscript MOOC, or even learn from a stranger.<br>Critical thinking: After we learn the new thing, we start a debate on it, think about how it is work, and is it a reliable knowledge, and how we can use it in our own.<br>Articulation: After we process the new learning to become our knowledge, we share it with people around us, it can be written in a post or article, repeat thinking about the knowledge. We should speak out loud for sharing and it can strengthen our memory.</p><p>Learning is from an input, and processing becomes an output, we consume the knowledge we learn, reflect on it, and implement it in our life.</p>]]></content>

People like to do things that are able to get immediate responses and feel easy to do it, like reply email or doing a small task, it lets us feel that we are doing something. However, it didn’t bring much value to our time.</p><p>Big things are something that not easy to achieve, it requires us to give hard work on it, and takes time to work on it to get some outcomes. Most of the time, we are procrastinating to work on the big things since it needs more effort, more focus, and consume more time on it. However, it will bring a huge effect on our life when we achieve it, it worth our time to spend on it. </p><blockquote><p>It’s more important to do big things well than to do small things perfectly. - Ray Dalio</p></blockquote><p>Get things done and make life easy. I’m still learning to make the small things done but not make it perfect. Sometimes, when I doing the small things, I like to make it perfect and waste a lot of time in the details. Nevertheless, stop being a perfectionist is a good achievement.</p><p>Begin with the end in mind, Stephen Covey wrote in his book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. When we get started to do something, we can make a clear vision of the desired direction and destination, imaging the thing that had been completed, and how will it looks like. This action can give us some motivation to work on it and make things happen, done lately is better than no progress.</p><p>Value your time and waste your time in something that makes values in your life.</p>]]></content>

Based-on the wood barrel theory, the shortest plank is way more important than the longest plank, you can’t bring more water with longer plank cause water will lacking from the shortest plank, this reflects as a weak point in a person. In most of the case, we can do a lot with our strengths but sometimes we will fail in our weaknesses. Thus, we have to admit it, highlighting them, diagnosing them, thinking about what should be done differently in the future, in order to fix the weaknesses.</p><p>You may feel that recognizing our weak point is not that easy process, we need to do the reflection on the mistake we did, understand the root cause, and admit on it. Finding out that you are wrong is even more valuable than being right because you are learning, you are fixing the shorter plank of your life.</p><p>Indeep, sometimes we had identified our weak point but we don’t know how to solve it, it will bring more stress altogether. However, when we understand the problem we have, we can look into it more details, start researching to find out the solution, read something that can enhance our mindset. When you realized you don’t know, means that you already know.  </p><blockquote><p>Yet fixing unacceptable problems is actually a lot easier than not fixing them, because not fixing them will make you miserable. - Ray Dalio</p></blockquote><p>I strongly believe that we need to fix our weaknesses, try to improve a little bit on it and life will be better when we conquer it. Even though we can’t overcome our weak point in some cases, at least we can avoid it when we know what it is and do more things to cover it, it will be more beneficial than knowing nothing about it.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of people are scared about making mistakes, we thought a mistake is a bad thing that we need to avoid, but I think we should accept the mistake we made and learn from it, even though it’s not easy. Sometimes it’s very hard to admit the mistake we made in front of other people, it felt like we are telling people that we are not smart enough or we are stupid, but that’s not true. Some people admit the mistake and also learn from it, look into it, and avoid making it again. This time, a mistake became a good experience rather than a bad experience.</p><p>School learning overemphasizes the value of having the right answers and punishes the wrong answers, that’s why we terrified to do the odd thing and choose the safest way to avoid mistakes. The second option appears to be in flat contradiction of the first option, the safest way may not be the right way. Sometimes we need to do a mistake to get the right answer, a mistake can end up being the best decision you ever make, not making mistakes is the biggest mistake.</p><blockquote><p>The worst mistake is not facing up to mistakes - Ray Dalio</p></blockquote><p>Michael Jordan, he became a champion and the greatest basketball player because he loved using his mistakes to improve himself instead of avoiding mistakes and do the normal things. Maybe we can’t become a legend like him, but we should learn from him, learn from our mistakes, and step up on it to go farther.</p><p>To think, how to sidestep mistakes and not doing anything, this will bring us nothing. Though, we should be careful and think deeply before we make a decision, although we can only know the outcome by doing it. Well, we may feel pain when making a mistake, but the regret of not doing it is more painful.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Life keeps require us to make decisions, each decision is linked to the next decision. When we are in school, we make the decision that we want to study hard or play hard, it was linked to another decision after we graduated. If we choose to continue to study and go into college, we need to pick what course we want and make another decision again. If we choose to get a job, we have to think about what we can do and which field we want to work on, it requires another decision. Each decision is like a chain that links to the next opportunity and it is very hard to reverse back.</p><p>We aren’t born with the ability to make good decisions, but we can learn about it. Everyone starts from zero experience, no one had the knowledge. In the beginning, someone may have an unfair advantage like the environment they bornt, though. We will start with a lot of the decisions we made, no matter good or bad decisions. Whenever we realized we make a bad decision, we should accept the cause and effect, we shouldn’t blame on it and felt regret about the decision we made. I think this will waste the effort that we did for making the decision, it could be an important experience in our life, it could help us to avoid the next bad decision that could happen. </p><p>The quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we made. When something requires us to make a decision, we can pick the easiest option, and accept it to fall as commonplace. However, the easiest option may not be a good decision, we should try to execute a different decision, gain a different experience so that we can make a change in our life. </p><p>Fortune is grasped by our own hands, we can draft our life with unexpected results.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>A dream is just a dream. A goal is a dream with a plan and a deadline. - Harvey Mackay</p></blockquote><p>Goal setting is such an important process to achieve your plan or target, it involves action plans and measurable targets, it can be used in your life or your career. A goal is like a compass, it is able to help you to stick to your plan and let you know where you are, it will bring you a clear image of your thought. </p><p>Sometimes we are seeking new things in our life, we wanted to do something that we thought is good for us, we want to change our life, leave the comfort zone though it is not easy. We can step out of the first step, think about what we want, and how to get it. We can set a goal and start to plan about it, take action, it will motivate us in the process. </p><p>Working and learning in the process of pursuing these goals, create an action plan for it. The action plan is what you need to do to achieve the goal you set, the requirement to get on your goal, and the difficult part to achieve it. Follow the plan and implement it step by step, bit by bit, this process can be very tough it depends on what you want. To keep in track of your plan and obtaining your goal,  you need to work on your plan consistently and get the result in the end. A lot of things that are not as a fast game, we are nothing working hard to get the things first but to keep the things lasting. Doing this over and over again is the personal evolutionary process.</p><p>Do the things simple, and repeat doing the simple things. Setting a goal is simple but important, we can have a clear image of what we want instead of doing everything that we think we should. Set a simple goal, get a hard result.</p>]]></content>

But I think we need to learn from our mistakes and learn how to admit to it, this is not easy and we need to expose us to the feedback.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back then in 2016, I was working in Panasonic Senai as a software engineer, I got an opportunity to travel to Japan with a business trip. At that time I have just working in Panasonic Senai around 9 months, and one of the departments in our company just setting up a new system developed by Panasonic Japan members. By chance, I had been assigned to maintain this system and handle future enhancement. In order to handover the system, Japan members requested I to travel to Tokyo to meet them and they will handover all the information related to this system to me.</p><p>This is my first-time travel to Japan and Tokyo, I felt very excited to visit Tokyo since it is a prosperous city and the top fashion culture in Asia. I did a lot of research about it and planned my travel schedule and those places I wanted to visits. This business trip is around 6 days and I need to work from 9 am to 5 pm, but I still able to travel around after work. I work with Japan members in the Panasonic Tokyo office, it is a sales distribution center, that’s why it allocated in the Tokyo city in a huge office building. </p><p>My department head was with me for the first two days on this business trip, he brought me to having dinner with Japan members after work. We went to have some drinks, it is a Japanese Beer Buffet with snacks. After that, he leaves me alone to work with Japan members.      He guild me to learn how to take the train to the office from the hotel that we stay in, but I was once get lost when I went off from the office to the hotel. I’m using GPS and Google Maps but I still can’t find the way to the hotel, luckily I asked a Japanese to guild me back, I took one hour lost and back to the hotel that only needs 10 mins journey.</p><p>The Japan member treated me very well, he brought me to travel around after work, he guild me on how to go to the place I wanted to visits. They also bought me some lunch since the living cost in Tokyo is very high, a meal costs around 35 Ringgit Malaysia, it is very expensive for me since I’m just a fresh graduate with a low salary at that moment.</p><p>This is a very special experience for me,  I felt that Japan is very big different compare with Malaysia, the culture and the society are very unique and attractive. I felt blessed to have this opportunity to travel to Tokyo Japan, thanks to my department head and the Japan members.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quality Control (QC) is a very important part of a manufacturing company, they have to ensure the products they produce have no issue and in good quality. When I working in Panasonic Senai, Quality Control is the most focused process along with the production since the vision of Panasonic is to produce the product that can be lasting a long period with good quality. When a customer reported a quality issue in a Panasonic product, we need to recall all the products produced in the same patch even the product was ship to oversea.</p><p>We do the Quality Control process starts from raw material, production line, finished goods, and packing before it ships to customers. These whole processes are running with some tools and managed in the system. When the raw material arrived in the store warehouse from vendors, QC members will go and take some raw materials as sampling for the Quality Control process, they doing this process with system control. The system will record down the material and quantity that being Quality Control process and reflect into stock quantity, this will help the store members to manage the stock and prevent stock missing or stock quantity not tally. </p><p>In the production line, we have some tools to test the functionality of the product, we use OCR with a high-quality camera to check the assemble process and installation process, this can prevent the human mistake like installing a part with the wrong direction. </p><p>During the packing process, production operators pack the completed product in a box with some user manual and some documentation. In order to prevent human mistakes like missing user manual with the packed box, we implement a system by the name of Weight Checker System. This system will pre-configured with the weight of the packed product and the allowed differences in milligrams, it will trigger an alert when the weight of the packed product is not in the range of the standard weight, it means something wrong in the packing.</p><p>This is a good opportunity for me to learn more about the business processes in a manufacturing company and the Quality Control is really important for a company, it can deploy a company if some bad thing happen.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Panasonic Senai, we have a department managing the raw material for the production lines, they control the material that needed in the production to ensure the production lines can run smoothly. They have to work with Store members to prepare the raw material followed by the production plan, all the material will move to the production warehouse from the Store warehouse.</p><p>Before production lines start running and produce finish goods, they follow the material listing to collect all the raw materials needed for the production, each product has at least 20 raw materials. They need to collect and count the material carefully since different material has a different quantity for each type of product, they need to follow the material listing and production plan and split it into multiple production lines. Sometimes there have some quality issues in the production line that running haft way, they need to stop the production and collect back all the raw material and put the balance back to the production warehouse. These business processes are involved in a lot of manual processes and it costs a lot of manpower. In order to enhance these processes, top management requested the IT department to implement a system to optimize it.</p><p>When our department working on this project, I had been assigned to join in and support the implementation. After we study and understand the whole process, we implemented some new processes for them to work with the system to reduce the workload and prevent human error, instead of doing everything in manual ways. They can download the enhanced material listing that auto-generate with production plans and production lines. We also implement the QR code system to help them to collect material and manage production warehouse. This system can reduce around 50% of the workload and prevent inventory discrepancies. They do the stock check with more efficiently and accurately, they increate the stock check routine to weekly from twice a month. However, in the beginning, we need to put a lot of effort to implement it, design the layout, printout the QR code, and allocate it one by one.</p><p>This is a huge change for them, they need to adapt to the new process and change their working habit, this is not easy for them since they are used to the old manual process, they need to be open-minded to accept the new things that can improve their workload.</p>]]></content>

The complicated part is they need to cooperate with multiple parties, members from other departments, and outside vendors, they need to ensure the production line can run smoothly. This business process runs a highly important part of a manufacturing company.</p><p>Everything starts from the Sales Order. They receive the Sales Order from Panasonic Japan with the target shipment date, normally they will receive the order 6 months in advance. They need to calculate the raw material from the required products to start planning the production. They contact the suppliers of the raw material and manage the estimated delivery date, so they can start planing the production line and arrange production shifts. After that, they need to work with the Logistics member for the shipment date and reply estimated arrived date to customers. </p><p>Plans always fall behind changes. Sometime the production plan will be affected by multiple issues such as delayed material delivery, production quality control issues, etc. They need to respond immediately and roll out a new production plan to prevent the delay of arriving in customers, like fire fighting. There are a lot of complicated processes and manual works.</p><p>In order to optimize the business process and prevent human error, we control most of the processes in our ERP system, SAP. Most of the documents will go through the system and connect with vendors and suppliers, but they still need to do human decisions like production planning and forecast. I had been assigned to create a system for them with the production forecast planning. This system will collect all the Sales Order and the raw material dataset to calculate and forecast the production plan. It also connects with the Inventory system to highlight the material shortage in a dashboard, so they can easy to monitor the raw material with the production plan.</p><p>I got this opportunity to study and understand the production business process, this is a rare experience for me and I can’t easily learn about it from other companies, this experience brings me forward in my career.</p>]]></content>

They are doing a repair service for the end-user who using the Panasonic laptop. Most of the customers have come from Panasonic Singapore or other corporate end-user. This repair service business model has good potential since Panasonic Taiwan is the only main provider in Asia. Previously, this Repair Service is provided by Panasonic Singapore, but due to the high labor costs, we try to undertake this business since we have an unfair advantage in the operation costs. Panasonic Singapore also agrees to move their customers to us.</p><p>Panasonic Senai becomes the window person who provides repair service. Customers ship their device to us by post service and C&amp;R members will receive it and start doing their operation. They have to record down all the serial numbers of the devices to prevent miss-match with the wrong customer. After they complete the diagnosis of device and feedback to the customer if they wanted to repair or send back to them. C&amp;R member has to check the warranty information if the device is still under warranty or the device was configured by the C&amp;R Configuration team. There are some complicated workflows involved in human processes. They have to do diagnosing with following the documentation and instruction provider by Panasonic Japan. They have to handle customer service and feedback, sometimes they have the warranty issues in the system.</p><p>We implemented a system to assist them to manage all the business processes, everything will log in system, so this will enhance the traceability of their repair jobs. This system will help them to control the goods-in and goods-out process to prevent human error. Since their repair parts can share with the Configuration team, we implement inventory management in the system and forecast the usage of the repair parts, this will help them on the inventory purchase request. This process will reduce the customer waiting time when their repair part is not available.</p><p>This system was developed by Japan members but handover to me to maintain it. I also do the enhancement with C&amp;R members to improve the business process and reduce operator workload. This gave me a good opportunity to learn new things and improve myself.</p>]]></content>

My company just started a new department with a new business modal which is C&amp;R, C&amp;R stands for Configuration and Repair. This business is focused on support Panasonic’s laptop and tablet which are TOUGHBOOK and TOUGHPAD. They do the customize configuration for the new devices such as install GPS sensors or upgrade software and OS. And the repair team will focus on repair customer’s TOUGHBOOK such as hardware that broken or spoilt. </p><p>There is a huge demand from oversea counties like the UK and the US. Panasonic in the UK has a company which doing the same thing as C&amp;R but the labor costs are very high, so we have the cost advantage in Malaysia. Most of the new devices are produced in Taiwan, then they will ship to us and do configuration before send out to customers.</p><p>The complicated part of this business is in the inventory. Since we can’t stock all the configuration parts and devices, so we have to keep track of the Sales Order to do the forecast for goods requests and orders.

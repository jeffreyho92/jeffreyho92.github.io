    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As an easy definition, the Law of Attraction is the belief that positive thoughts will bring positive experiences. It uses the power of our mind to translate whatever is in our thoughts and materialize them into reality. Simply put, all thoughts will turn into things eventually. If you think about negative things you will remain under that cloud. If you think about positive thoughts you will find a way to achieve them with action. We are acting as human magnets sending out our thoughts and emotions and attracting back more of what we have put out.</p><p>Many people think that the Law of Attraction is just visualizing what we want and wait for it to come. However, this is unreasonable. I think that is not exactly how it works. There is something missing in the idea, no matter how much time and effort we put into visualizing our success, all we will ever be is a person with a dream. As they said, we can’t have the things that we never had until we do the things that we have never done. We can’t do the same thing but expecting different results.</p><blockquote><p>Dreams don’t work unless you take action. - Roy T. Bennett</p></blockquote><p>In order to use the power of the Law of Attraction and make our dreams come true, there is one key ingredient we must integrate into our life: ACTION. Visualization and internal work are important but that doesn’t mean we can ignore the action step altogether. Once we have the inner work to get clear on mind, the action work comes far more easily. We have to take action and take all of the required steps to make our vision a reality. </p><p>As soon as we start to activate the Law of Attraction and gain more traction, it will be much easy to focus on positive things, ignore negative things, and achieve our goals.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everything is different nowadays, distraction is everywhere and happened anytime. There are so many things that distracted our attention and took away our time. We take our smartphones with us everywhere we go, we spend a lot of time on social media, messages, and news. We got distracted more often than we’d like. The reason why we got it is one of the biggest secrets that most tech-companies don’t want us to know.</p><p>Dopamine Hacking. </p><blockquote><p>Dopamine is a neurochemical which is released every time your brain anticipates a reward such as entertainment, information, novelty, or stimulation.</p></blockquote><p>When dopamine is released, it makes us feel good, so our brain wants more of it. Just like a fat kid who loves chocolate cake. This is why our brain will stimulate us to repeat the behaviors that led to a dopamine release.</p><p>Common distractions such as social media, news, and even email have been intentionally designed to trigger an incredibly strong dopamine release. It is much more dopamine release than most of our work does. It is purposely chosen by the companies behind the apps. In fact, their entire business model depends on it. The stronger the dopamine release, the more time we will spend on these distractions, and the more money they make.</p><p>This is a concept called “attention-hacking”. It happened when we want to do something that matters most at the time like reading or study. We got distracted from our smartphone, it gave us an immediate response with dopamine release, we got addicted to it as we felt happy and enjoyable. It’s quickly destroying people’s ability to stay focused. Our brain is being hijacked by meaningless things, and it prevents us from working on meaningful things.</p><p>When we understand this concept, we will be able to easily block distractions in our daily life and allow us to focus deeply on things that truly matter.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What is the key to success that they have picked up, but we can’t do it and even can’t see it. Success looks like a gift given to other people but not us. Why their success seems like effortless. </p><p>Success does not always based-on luck, it comes from hard work. If we are hungry enough, we put our effort to find a way to achieve success, with all in. We surround ourselves with the right people who managed to achieve something that we are looking for. It means surrounding the mindset of a winner and always tempting to achieve more. We can model their strategy.</p><p>Modeling means learning by following the behavior of other people. Humans naturally model each other, like children modeling their parents, follow what their parents do. Modeling is a technique used by those who willing to learn from other people. People who do modeling have a growth mindset. Those people believe that just as we learn behaviors, we can learn from the experiences of successful people. </p><p>Modeling also happens in the organization. The staff could be modeling his manager in doing some tasks, and often modeling is unintentional. Company culture is also a model that lead by the leaders in the organization, everyone modeling the culture involuntary.</p><p>Modeling in psychology has become a mainstream theory. Whether in career or life, select a person you admire to become, study the methodology behind their success, learn from their strategy, and follow the similar path to achieve it. Look for someone who already achieves the things that you wanted to do or someone who has created the kind of life that you want to live. Look into their history, what kind of difficulties they face, and how they overcome. Use their experiences to build a path to mirrors theirs.</p><blockquote><p>Success Leaves Clues - Tony Robbins</p></blockquote><p>Most successful people have the similar strategy that we can be modeling it. Modeling is a skill set that we can learn and keep improving on it.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First-principles thinking is one of the best ways of reverse engineering for complicated problems. The idea is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the group up.  First-principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world. This way of thinking helps us removes the common assumptions that might be wrong, also knowns as Cognitive Bias.</p><p>Most of the time, people are reasoning by analogy. We look at something that was done before or something else that other people are doing it. A lot of things that we believe are based on some authority figure telling us that is true. As children, we learn to stop questioning when we are told “Because I said so.” As adults, we learn to stop questioning when people say “Because that’s how it works.”</p><blockquote><p>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. - Albert Einstein</p></blockquote><p>Children instinctively think in first principles. They like to ask “Why” until they understand the thing. However, audits will always think that we are doing this because it is always been done that way. We are not doing it because nobody else ever done that, so it must not be good. But this is just a lazy way of thinking. We have to build up the reasoning from the group up. We can try to understand the reality with what is true, not with our intuition.  If we let other people think for us means that we are using their analogies or their experiences. People’s thinking is framed by someone else and it could be wrong.</p><p>The power of first-principles thinking is not only for improvement but also increases the possibility. Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of conventional wisdom. We can reason by first principles, by analogy, or a blend of the two.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>It’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters. - Epictetus</p></blockquote><p>What sets the world’s successful people apart is not what happens to them, but how they react to the things that happened to them. It’s their response to a challenge or a difficulty that separates them from most of us. When something happens, the only thing you can control is your attitude toward it, you can either accept it or blame it.</p><p>When we run into an obstacle such as the covid pandemic, it is easy to just give up and throw in the white towel. However, this will not be going to make our life any better. I saw a lot of people around me they think 2020 should end as quickly as possible to avoid any bad things happen. I don’t think that is a good mindset to have. I think that we can reflect on what we did during this crisis, and how we can improve on it. For example, we should prepare for uncertainty like having multiple sources of income for diversity. To be our best self as often as possible, be equipped for our path towards a better future.</p><p>If possible, inspire others to do the same in that process. Remember, we are in the same challenge together. People need a spark of light in these times, and we can decide to be that light. When we doing reflect on other people, we are learning from their experiences too, we can use it as our observation. </p><p>During the stay at home period, we can learn some new skills that will help us to be better, it is the time for us to improve ourself. Finish a few tasks that we are wanted to do for a long time, so we can start with a clean sheet.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Four big lessons that guide the business thinking from the entrepreneurs who come from Silicon Valley, after the dot-com bubble.</p><ol><li><p>Make incremental advances: A lot of entrepreneurs dream big and wanted to change the world. They are enjoying the brilliant idea that may change the way of how the world is working. They are seeking incredible fast growth and ignore the tiny little disadvantage. They prefer short term advantage instead of long term advantage. However, the focus on constant growth is the key. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward.</p></li><li><p>Stay lean and flexible: “All companies must be lean, which is code for unplanned.” We can’t predict the future of the business. We should not know what it will do, planning is inflexible. We should prepare for the unknown circumstances, assume that we will be affected by the uncertainty. Instead, we should try things out, and treat entrepreneurship as experimentation.</p></li><li><p>Improve on the competition: “Don’t try to create a new market prematurely.” We should start with an existing customer to know that we are in a real business. We should improve the existing products that are already offered by successful competitors. By doing this, we can recognize that we are building something that somebody wants. </p></li><li><p>Focus on product, not sales: “If your product requires advertising to sell it, it’s not good enough. The only sustainable growth is viral growth.” Salespeople are important, but the great product speaks for itself. Although we still need marketing, we should look at it as exposure. We should give the great product a chance to speaks.</p></li></ol><p>These lessons have become dogma in the startup world. We should focus more on real demand instead of bright future ideas. We need to rethink what is needed for people and what is good to have but not important.</p><blockquote><p>The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself. - Peter Thiel </p></blockquote>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Occam’s Razor - William of Ockham</p></blockquote><p>Occam’s Razor is a mental model, problem-solving principle, to solve problems more quickly and efficiently. Explain in a nutshell, the simplest solution is often the best solution. When the thing can be simple, don’t make it complicated. When the complex solution and simple solution both work equally, we should choose the simple solution. The simpler a theory is, the more easily it can be verified. The simpler a solution is, the more easily it can be executed. </p><blockquote><p>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. - Albert Einstein</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, we want to implement a solution that can solve a lot of problems or issues. We want to put all the things that we have into one solution to prove that what we can do, but this will make things more complicated.  We try to create one method that can solve everything. However, this will make things complicated to understand, bring more mistakes to occur, and it is unlikely to lead to a manageable prediction.</p><p>A Mental model works best for making initial conclusions before the full information of the problem can be collected. We can have this mental model as a tool in our mental toolbox to give an immediate response when something happens.</p><p>Simple is as simple does, we can choose the easiest solution to get thing done. It is better than stuck in a complex solution and do nothing. You have got to see the forest before you can see the trees. </p><p>Nevertheless, if the complex solution does a better job than the simple solution, then we should pick the complex one. And making it too simple might not only be impracticable to solve the issue. Occam’s razor is not intended as a replacement for critical thinking. It is just a tool to help make that thinking more effective.</p>]]></content>

However, how to get the chance is a big question for me. Most of the people have this feeling in their life too, we always waiting for someone to provide us the opportunity to spend time and hustle into something.</p><p>Refer to those articles that I read, and do some study on it, they always talk about some common points. If you want to master a skill, you have to understand it, it takes practice, time, and persistence. Ask yourself, who is the leader in the industry that is absolutely crushing it, who is the icon in that specific field, who is the first person that you recall in your mind. We can do some research on what makes them successful, what skills are required to achieve your target. Map out the list of things that you would like to implement and start practicing.</p><p>We should start with setting an intention, identify what skillset needs to learn, then comes practice, then comes failing, then comes learning, then it is a habit and becomes a part of you.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mental Model represents how things work, or an explanation of a person’s thinking process. Our thinking quality is based on the models in the brain, and our brain will automatically trigger different thinking models in different situations. The more models you have, the bigger your toolbox will be, and you will be able to look at the same thing with different thinking models and different perspectives.</p><ol><li><p>Inversion<br>Its origins can be found in the word “invert”, which is simply means “turn upside down”. Normally, when we want to make a good impression, we will think about doing something good to prove ourselves, but we should think about what bad things we should not be done. It can also be like rather than thinking about what you want, consider what you’d like to avoid. </p></li><li><p>Second-order thinking<br>Every action has a consequence and further consequences, it like a chain, connecting every action or circumstance. These are called second-order effects. In this model of thinking, we can think about the chained effect that will happen with all the actions we take, to avoid potentially making a bad decision. Second-order thinking enables us to discover the long-term result of our actions.</p></li><li><p>Pareto Principle<br>Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, often happens in our world, but we are not aware of it. The Pareto Principle specifies that for many results, 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. To put it simply, 80% of the result we got came from 20% of our hard work, which means that we should use 20% of our time to focus on the most important thing that can bring us 80% of a good result. Accept imperfection, and stop being a perfectionist.</p></li></ol><p>A mental model is a very good tool which can help us make better decisions in our life. However, it is not easily accessible but once we start using it, we will implement it on a daily basis in almost everything.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If let me think about the busiest person in the world, I immediately think of Elon Musk. How he can get so many things done every single day 24/7. He could be the Busyman in the business world, or whatever you name it. He managing Teala, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and the list keep going. Those companies he is working on that all changing the course of humanity. Even managing just one of those would be one hell of a project, every day dealing with uncertainty. I mean, with SpaceX alone he is trying to get us to Mars, this is insane.</p><p>Therefore, what does Elon Musk do differently from most other people, that makes him so extremely productive, get so many things done in all different area. Well, I think one thing is very clear, he is big on prioritization. He once said, “Focus on signal over noise. Don’t waste time on stuff that doesn’t actually make things better.” This sounds like a simple idea that everyone was known, but it is not easy to apply in our daily tasks.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is common to hear the advice that people should take some risk and uncertainty if they want to be successful. Risk can separate into two different types, calculated risk, and non-calculated risk. I think knowing what you do and taking a risk with knowledge is calculated risk. When you have the knowledge of the things you are doing, you can handle the uncertainty, you can calculate the risk.</p><p>However, does risk-taking can lead to success or it is essential to be successful? For me, the answer depends on several factors, different people doing the same thing can lead to a different result. Successful people tend to take risks in ways that limit their potential losses.</p><blockquote><p>Entrepreneurs are not risk takers. They are calculated risk takers. - Leonard C. Green</p></blockquote><p>“The difference between risk-takers and calculated risk-takers is the difference between failure and success,” Green said. To be honest, this ideal looks like a survivorship bias, when the risk-taker becomes successful, we will think this is a good risk to take, but when the risk-taker becomes a failure, we will think this is a bad risk. In order to avoid survivorship bias, we need to look at the same thing in different ways and different perspectives. Take some time to study to get knowledge, we should look at the failure case, it is way more important than look at the success case. When we have the knowledge, we know how to play the game and applying some strategies.</p><p>Risk-taking does have some relative with success, but there are too many complicated factors to say that taking the risk will increase your chances to become successful. Even though those successful people also need to find ways to mitigate damage and lower the risks they take.</p>]]></content>

Everything has two sides, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Crisis entails opportunities, we should try to look at the other side to avoid bias, though it is not easy but doable.</p><p>During this pandemic, a lot of people start doing digital marketing, they saw other people are doing something, so they also want to follow the trend, but this fall into the herd mentality, people can be influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most adaptable to change. - Charles Darwin</p></blockquote><p>Should we follow other people doing the same things to avoid falling behind, or should we accommodate ourselves to adopt the new changes in the environment, I prefer the second one. When we follow the trend, doing the same things as other people doing, we are stuck in the 80% crowd, we can’t stand out in this situation. </p><p>The other option is don’t follow other people but improve ourselves to stay in the game, learning new skills that essential to survive in the environment. I think this is better than following other people back since we are growing with new experiences and it doesn’t hurt to trying new things. Even though step out of our comfort zone and overcome the challenges in a new environment is not easy, we are taking a risk and opening ourselves up to the possibility of stress, it will be tough but it is worth spending effort on it.</p><p>Even if I fail now, the skills I have acquiring will be valuable in the future, it will become my weapon to fight the next challenges.</p>]]></content>

Dealing with other people’s opinions can be tough since you don’t know that is good or bad for you, people may think it is good maybe it works for them, but actually, it can be bad for you.</p><p>When you dealing with the opinion that you don’t agree with and the person insists on giving you his opinion and want you to make a decision on it. At this point, opinion becomes troublesome, how to decline people’s opinion is like a martial art.

When we took the opinion and realized it is bad for us, the first time what we need to do is make a reflection on it, instead of blaming other people.</p><p>Don’t argue for other people’s opinions. Don’t argue for your own. When you make a mistake, admit it, correct it, and learn from it. We should get improve from other people’s opinions, rather than become worst from it. We can don’t follow the opinion if we thought it is not useful for us, it depends on different situations and the way you see it through.</p><p>Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. The opinion is thought from other people but implements on our own. We should take responsibility for it, think about the opinion with our personal situation, instead of following blindly.

Learning is the very first step of change, learning is just a small part of the puzzle, but it’s the most important part. Sometimes we feel hard to take the step out due to procrastination or lack of intention, or maybe we read it once then we thought we had learned about it, but this is not true.</p><p>As Alvin Toffler mentioned in his book, the 21st-century learning process:</p><blockquote><p>Learn -&gt; Unlearn -&gt; Re-learn</p></blockquote><p>Learn: Getting the new things that we had never seen or known before, and take it as our knowledge.<br>Unlearn: After we learn the knowledge, it is open to objection. We should do some reflection on it, is it matching with our faith, should we agree with that point of view, we can be opposed to it.<br>Re-learn: After the reflection process, we re-learn the knowledge and come out with our own beliefs. This is such an important process that we can learn the knowledge that suite our past and future.</p><p>As Chris Do mention in his video, this is the new generation of the education process:</p><blockquote><p>Self-learning -&gt; Critical thinking -&gt; Articulation</p></blockquote><p>Self-learning: We can learn what we wanted to learn through searching Google, read a book, join an online course, subscript MOOC, or even learn from a stranger.<br>Critical thinking: After we learn the new thing, we start a debate on it, think about how it is work, and is it a reliable knowledge, and how we can use it in our own.<br>Articulation: After we process the new learning to become our knowledge, we share it with people around us, it can be written in a post or article, repeat thinking about the knowledge. We should speak out loud for sharing and it can strengthen our memory.</p><p>Learning is from an input, and processing becomes an output, we consume the knowledge we learn, reflect on it, and implement it in our life.</p>]]></content>

Most of the time, we are procrastinating to work on the big things since it needs more effort, more focus, and consume more time on it. However, it will bring a huge effect on our life when we achieve it, it worth our time to spend on it. </p><blockquote><p>It’s more important to do big things well than to do small things perfectly. - Ray Dalio</p></blockquote><p>Get things done and make life easy. I’m still learning to make the small things done but not make it perfect. Sometimes, when I doing the small things, I like to make it perfect and waste a lot of time in the details. Nevertheless, stop being a perfectionist is a good achievement.</p><p>Begin with the end in mind, Stephen Covey wrote in his book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. When we get started to do something, we can make a clear vision of the desired direction and destination, imaging the thing that had been completed, and how will it looks like.

In most of the case, we can do a lot with our strengths but sometimes we will fail in our weaknesses. Thus, we have to admit it, highlighting them, diagnosing them, thinking about what should be done differently in the future, in order to fix the weaknesses.</p><p>You may feel that recognizing our weak point is not that easy process, we need to do the reflection on the mistake we did, understand the root cause, and admit on it.

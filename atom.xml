    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been working in a manufacturing company (Panasonic) as an in-house software developer. The scopes of in-house software are supporting internal business workflows, improve productivity and increase product quality. Since all software is used by our employees, so as a software developer, I have to understand our company’s business workflows and what are they doing in each department.</p><p>I still can remember when I had been assigned to support a Purchase Request system. I have to work with the Corporate Purchasing Department. I did the feasibility study of purchasing workflow. It is quite a complicated workflow involved clerk, purchaser, administrator, and vendor. A purchase request basically can split into two categories which are Regular Request and Ad-hoc Request. The Regular Request is repeatable every week or every month, so it has a fixed vendor. The Ad-hoc Request is a special request like ordering a machine or purchase a service. The ad-hoc request needs management to approve and get acknowledgment.</p><p>In order to get a clear idea of the process, I have to follow the purchaser run through the whole process, like a clerk submit a request form to request purchase, the administrator verifies the request and gets approval from management. Finance has to approve the request then the purchaser submits a purchase order to the vendor and gets the delivery timeline from the vendor. Each of the workflows needed a clear vision and well designed in the system.</p><p>I realized that every department is working as a chain that links with each other. It required a lot of communication and good cooperation between each employee. As a software developer, I have to communicate with people coming from different backgrounds, get experience from them and sometimes I have to learn how to convince them when needed.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back then, I was working in Panasonic Senai, our top management is looking for an inventory system since our members are doing in a manual way of inventory management that lasted 30 years. They manual verify incoming material and manually enter all data into our ERP system which is SAP system. They manual do the stock check with human counting twice a month. These manual ways of working brought about human errors, inefficiency business processes, and cheating in goods lost. These are big problem for our company, it’s very hard to manage and affect our company’s profit.</p><p>As a software engineer in Panasonic Senai, I was involved in this project to study the current issues and come out with a solution. We make a comparison between in-house development and outsource development. In-house development can save costs but outsource development can save time. After a few discussions with our department manager and top management. Finally, they decided to assign the development to the outsourcing company but we have to maintain and enhance the system in the future. This project was assigned to an outsourcing company which is Deloitte. Deloitte is a UK company and they have a lot of professional SAP consultants, that’s why this project took around one million Ringgit Malaysia and implemented within 6 months.</p><p>Unfortunately, it happens a lot of issues after implement this system. Our members were frustrated with this new system since they think this new system does not help them to reduce their works but brings more works to them. However, this new system is a good practice and it can help them to prevent human error. I found out that they were frustrated because they didn’t want to accept new things and new workflows. It is a big impact on them as they felt very comfortable in their current workflows and they felt very hard to adapt to new technologies. It is a mindset issue that has to solve on mindset, not the system.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>You make your own luck - Jason Roberts</p></blockquote><p>How do you increase your chance of success? Your “Luck Surface Area” can help you. This is a term coined by Jason Roberts in a 2010 blog post. When the first time I saw this term I felt shocked, I did not know luck can have a surface area and you can control the amount of luck that you receive. </p><p>As I understand it, when you contribute something and people aware of it, you will get more opportunities. When you pour energy into a passion, you become an expert in one field, somebody will look for you. This idea does match my belief. I’ve always thought about learn more things and do more work will lead me to wider possibilities. When you do something you are passionate about and do something is valuable, people will feel interested and try to capture that value. When people need you more than you need people, you started to be valuable. </p><p><img src="/images/luck-surface-area.png" alt="Luck Surface Area" title="Luck Surface Area"></p><p>This is the graphical representation that really brings the concept home. However, I does not like the word “tell” in here instead of “aware”. Cause I think let people aware of your value is better than tell people what you have, it is harder to achieve though.</p><p>Although, how to make people aware of your value is a big question, it can be a long journey. Even though you are an expert in doing something but people do not aware of it, it will become nothing. Let others know of your worth are equally important and commonly be overlooked.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I join Panasonic Senai as a software technician in 2015, my starting salary was only RM1600 and after 3 months of probation, it becomes RM1650. This is quite a low salary but I felt excited went to work every day since I knew this is just temporary. I knew I can earn more salary in the future when I got more working experience.</p><p>Panasonic Senai is a manufacturer that produces telephone machines and fax machines with employed around 1000 employees including foreign workers. In Infomation System Department, we have 2 teams which are Infra team and Software team. I’m working in the Software team with 5 colleagues. In the beginning, my manager was led me to join the existing projects and understand the company’s system structure. Our team was assigned to support all in-house systems so I have to cooperate with other colleagues from other departments. I have to understand what are they doing and how the system can solve their problems. I found that it’s a big difference in actual working experience compare with what I learned in theory before.</p><p>After 3 months I was assigned to run a small project alone. It’s a booking system for book meeting rooms. Before I started this project, people who want to book a meeting room have to manage in an excel file which allocated in a shared folder. It’s very hard to check daily appointments and people have to calculate the available time manually. Sometimes people will accidentally remove or edited other people’s bookings. So I planed and developed a web application to solve these issues, it’s a calendar-based application, people can check and make a booking with a user-friendly interface.</p><p>One day I saw a colleague using this application to easily manage her booking and she told me it’s a very useful application. This is the first time I saw people using an application that developed by me, it’s an impressing feeling, I felt blessed to doing this.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back then, I was a Diploma graduate in 2015 who was young, dumb and broke. In Johor Bahru, people will always talk about working in Singapore since it’s just a bridge away and earning Singapore dollars is much more lucrative due to the high currency exchange rates. I feel like want to work in Singapore also to earn SGD since the currency exchange rate was 1SGD to 2.6RM at that moment.<br>However, I have zero working experience in my career as a software engineer. I believe it will be very hard to get a job for me as a foreign worker, so I decided to work in Johor Bahru to gain more experience and improve myself.</p><p>During my job search, my classmate got a job in a Malay company as a junior developer and he recommended me to join this company, so I went to an interview with his manager and successfully got a job offer with RM1200 monthly salary and the CEO also offer me to work in another branch in Kuala Lumpur. RM1200 is very low salary since the average for a fresh graduate student is RM1800 in JB, RM2200 in KL. At that time I felt like I needed more working experience so I accepted the job offer and start working immediately in JB.</p><p>We need to work on Sunday, take off on Friday and Saturday since it’s a Malay company and I’m the only Chinese in whole company, so I have to accept the different culture. I can still remember that moment when my colleagues all go “sembahyang” pray twice a day during working hours, I’m the only one who stayed in office with no one else. However I’m still good with my colleagues and learned a lot from them.</p><p>Unfortunately, I quit this company after 3 days but I still learned a lot. I saw that a government project has the potential to make billions of Ringgit. I felt like it’s very hard to accept their culture and I don’t like their project planning, every time have to do OT to rush their project timeline, luckily I did not accept the job offer that required me to move to KL.</p><p>Sometimes misfortune can actually be a blessing, I moved forward in my career and join another company, Panasonic.</p>]]></content>

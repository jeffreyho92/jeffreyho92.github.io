    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Occam’s Razor - William of Ockham</p></blockquote><p>Occam’s Razor is a mental model, problem-solving principle, to solve problems more quickly and efficiently. Explain in a nutshell, the simplest solution is often the best solution. When the thing can be simple, don’t make it complicated. When the complex solution and simple solution both work equally, we should choose the simple solution. The simpler a theory is, the more easily it can be verified. The simpler a solution is, the more easily it can be executed. </p><blockquote><p>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. - Albert Einstein</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, we want to implement a solution that can solve a lot of problems or issues. We want to put all the things that we have into one solution to prove that what we can do, but this will make things more complicated.  We try to create one method that can solve everything. However, this will make things complicated to understand, bring more mistakes to occur, and it is unlikely to lead to a manageable prediction.</p><p>A Mental model works best for making initial conclusions before the full information of the problem can be collected. We can have this mental model as a tool in our mental toolbox to give an immediate response when something happens.</p><p>Simple is as simple does, we can choose the easiest solution to get thing done. It is better than stuck in a complex solution and do nothing. You have got to see the forest before you can see the trees. </p><p>Nevertheless, if the complex solution does a better job than the simple solution, then we should pick the complex one. And making it too simple might not only be impracticable to solve the issue. Occam’s razor is not intended as a replacement for critical thinking. It is just a tool to help make that thinking more effective.</p>]]></content>

However, how to get the chance is a big question for me. Most of the people have this feeling in their life too, we always waiting for someone to provide us the opportunity to spend time and hustle into something.</p><p>Refer to those articles that I read, and do some study on it, they always talk about some common points. If you want to master a skill, you have to understand it, it takes practice, time, and persistence. Ask yourself, who is the leader in the industry that is absolutely crushing it, who is the icon in that specific field, who is the first person that you recall in your mind. We can do some research on what makes them successful, what skills are required to achieve your target. Map out the list of things that you would like to implement and start practicing.</p><p>We should start with setting an intention, identify what skillset needs to learn, then comes practice, then comes failing, then comes learning, then it is a habit and becomes a part of you. Consistency is the key, consistency leads to habits. This learning process is a formula that we can implement in almost everything. </p><blockquote><p>It’s not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives. It’s what we do consistently. - Anthony Robbins</p></blockquote><p>Remind ourselves, if you wait to be ready, you will be waiting forever.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mental Model represents how things work, or an explanation of a person’s thinking process. Our thinking quality is based on the models in the brain, and our brain will automatically trigger different thinking models in different situations. The more models you have, the bigger your toolbox will be, and you will be able to look at the same thing with different thinking models and different perspectives.</p><ol><li><p>Inversion<br>Its origins can be found in the word “invert”, which is simply means “turn upside down”. Normally, when we want to make a good impression, we will think about doing something good to prove ourselves, but we should think about what bad things we should not be done. It can also be like rather than thinking about what you want, consider what you’d like to avoid. </p></li><li><p>Second-order thinking<br>Every action has a consequence and further consequences, it like a chain, connecting every action or circumstance. These are called second-order effects. In this model of thinking, we can think about the chained effect that will happen with all the actions we take, to avoid potentially making a bad decision. Second-order thinking enables us to discover the long-term result of our actions.</p></li><li><p>Pareto Principle<br>Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, often happens in our world, but we are not aware of it. The Pareto Principle specifies that for many results, 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. To put it simply, 80% of the result we got came from 20% of our hard work, which means that we should use 20% of our time to focus on the most important thing that can bring us 80% of a good result. Accept imperfection, and stop being a perfectionist.</p></li></ol><p>A mental model is a very good tool which can help us make better decisions in our life. However, it is not easily accessible but once we start using it, we will implement it on a daily basis in almost everything.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If let me think about the busiest person in the world, I immediately think of Elon Musk. How he can get so many things done every single day 24/7. He could be the Busyman in the business world, or whatever you name it. He managing Teala, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and the list keep going. Those companies he is working on that all changing the course of humanity. Even managing just one of those would be one hell of a project, every day dealing with uncertainty. I mean, with SpaceX alone he is trying to get us to Mars, this is insane.</p><p>Therefore, what does Elon Musk do differently from most other people, that makes him so extremely productive, get so many things done in all different area. Well, I think one thing is very clear, he is big on prioritization. He once said, “Focus on signal over noise. Don’t waste time on stuff that doesn’t actually make things better.” This sounds like a simple idea that everyone was known, but it is not easy to apply in our daily tasks. We always get disturbed by urgent things, even though that is not really urgent. </p><p>By considering reducing the things that don’t matter (much), he frees up his limited time and energy for the things that do matter, and that is something we should all learn from him and apply in our daily jobs. First thing first and get things done.</p><p>When we prioritize the most valuable tasks over all the ‘busywork’ tasks, that is when we effectively improve our productivity. That is how we will be able to achieve much more in much less time. Everyone has the same amount of time, 24 hours per day, get more done in less time is the key.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is common to hear the advice that people should take some risk and uncertainty if they want to be successful. Risk can separate into two different types, calculated risk, and non-calculated risk. I think knowing what you do and taking a risk with knowledge is calculated risk. When you have the knowledge of the things you are doing, you can handle the uncertainty, you can calculate the risk.</p><p>However, does risk-taking can lead to success or it is essential to be successful? For me, the answer depends on several factors, different people doing the same thing can lead to a different result. Successful people tend to take risks in ways that limit their potential losses.</p><blockquote><p>Entrepreneurs are not risk takers. They are calculated risk takers. - Leonard C. Green</p></blockquote><p>“The difference between risk-takers and calculated risk-takers is the difference between failure and success,” Green said. To be honest, this ideal looks like a survivorship bias, when the risk-taker becomes successful, we will think this is a good risk to take, but when the risk-taker becomes a failure, we will think this is a bad risk. In order to avoid survivorship bias, we need to look at the same thing in different ways and different perspectives. Take some time to study to get knowledge, we should look at the failure case, it is way more important than look at the success case. When we have the knowledge, we know how to play the game and applying some strategies.</p><p>Risk-taking does have some relative with success, but there are too many complicated factors to say that taking the risk will increase your chances to become successful. Even though those successful people also need to find ways to mitigate damage and lower the risks they take.</p>]]></content>

When we follow the trend, doing the same things as other people doing, we are stuck in the 80% crowd, we can’t stand out in this situation. </p><p>The other option is don’t follow other people but improve ourselves to stay in the game, learning new skills that essential to survive in the environment. I think this is better than following other people back since we are growing with new experiences and it doesn’t hurt to trying new things.

Learning is the very first step of change, learning is just a small part of the puzzle, but it’s the most important part. Sometimes we feel hard to take the step out due to procrastination or lack of intention, or maybe we read it once then we thought we had learned about it, but this is not true.</p><p>As Alvin Toffler mentioned in his book, the 21st-century learning process:</p><blockquote><p>Learn -&gt; Unlearn -&gt; Re-learn</p></blockquote><p>Learn: Getting the new things that we had never seen or known before, and take it as our knowledge.<br>Unlearn: After we learn the knowledge, it is open to objection. We should do some reflection on it, is it matching with our faith, should we agree with that point of view, we can be opposed to it.<br>Re-learn: After the reflection process, we re-learn the knowledge and come out with our own beliefs. This is such an important process that we can learn the knowledge that suite our past and future.</p><p>As Chris Do mention in his video, this is the new generation of the education process:</p><blockquote><p>Self-learning -&gt; Critical thinking -&gt; Articulation</p></blockquote><p>Self-learning: We can learn what we wanted to learn through searching Google, read a book, join an online course, subscript MOOC, or even learn from a stranger.<br>Critical thinking: After we learn the new thing, we start a debate on it, think about how it is work, and is it a reliable knowledge, and how we can use it in our own.<br>Articulation: After we process the new learning to become our knowledge, we share it with people around us, it can be written in a post or article, repeat thinking about the knowledge.

People like to do things that are able to get immediate responses and feel easy to do it, like reply email or doing a small task, it lets us feel that we are doing something. However, it didn’t bring much value to our time.</p><p>Big things are something that not easy to achieve, it requires us to give hard work on it, and takes time to work on it to get some outcomes. Most of the time, we are procrastinating to work on the big things since it needs more effort, more focus, and consume more time on it. However, it will bring a huge effect on our life when we achieve it, it worth our time to spend on it. </p><blockquote><p>It’s more important to do big things well than to do small things perfectly. - Ray Dalio</p></blockquote><p>Get things done and make life easy. I’m still learning to make the small things done but not make it perfect. Sometimes, when I doing the small things, I like to make it perfect and waste a lot of time in the details. Nevertheless, stop being a perfectionist is a good achievement.</p><p>Begin with the end in mind, Stephen Covey wrote in his book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. When we get started to do something, we can make a clear vision of the desired direction and destination, imaging the thing that had been completed, and how will it looks like. This action can give us some motivation to work on it and make things happen, done lately is better than no progress.</p><p>Value your time and waste your time in something that makes values in your life.</p>]]></content>

In most of the case, we can do a lot with our strengths but sometimes we will fail in our weaknesses. Thus, we have to admit it, highlighting them, diagnosing them, thinking about what should be done differently in the future, in order to fix the weaknesses.</p><p>You may feel that recognizing our weak point is not that easy process, we need to do the reflection on the mistake we did, understand the root cause, and admit on it. Finding out that you are wrong is even more valuable than being right because you are learning, you are fixing the shorter plank of your life.</p><p>Indeep, sometimes we had identified our weak point but we don’t know how to solve it, it will bring more stress altogether. However, when we understand the problem we have, we can look into it more details, start researching to find out the solution, read something that can enhance our mindset. When you realized you don’t know, means that you already know.  </p><blockquote><p>Yet fixing unacceptable problems is actually a lot easier than not fixing them, because not fixing them will make you miserable. - Ray Dalio</p></blockquote><p>I strongly believe that we need to fix our weaknesses, try to improve a little bit on it and life will be better when we conquer it. Even though we can’t overcome our weak point in some cases, at least we can avoid it when we know what it is and do more things to cover it, it will be more beneficial than knowing nothing about it.</p>]]></content>

Sometimes it’s very hard to admit the mistake we made in front of other people, it felt like we are telling people that we are not smart enough or we are stupid, but that’s not true.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Life keeps require us to make decisions, each decision is linked to the next decision. When we are in school, we make the decision that we want to study hard or play hard, it was linked to another decision after we graduated. If we choose to continue to study and go into college, we need to pick what course we want and make another decision again. If we choose to get a job, we have to think about what we can do and which field we want to work on, it requires another decision. Each decision is like a chain that links to the next opportunity and it is very hard to reverse back.</p><p>We aren’t born with the ability to make good decisions, but we can learn about it. Everyone starts from zero experience, no one had the knowledge. In the beginning, someone may have an unfair advantage like the environment they bornt, though. We will start with a lot of the decisions we made, no matter good or bad decisions. Whenever we realized we make a bad decision, we should accept the cause and effect, we shouldn’t blame on it and felt regret about the decision we made. I think this will waste the effort that we did for making the decision, it could be an important experience in our life, it could help us to avoid the next bad decision that could happen. </p><p>The quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we made. When something requires us to make a decision, we can pick the easiest option, and accept it to fall as commonplace. However, the easiest option may not be a good decision, we should try to execute a different decision, gain a different experience so that we can make a change in our life. </p><p>Fortune is grasped by our own hands, we can draft our life with unexpected results.</p>]]></content>

A goal is like a compass, it is able to help you to stick to your plan and let you know where you are, it will bring you a clear image of your thought. </p><p>Sometimes we are seeking new things in our life, we wanted to do something that we thought is good for us, we want to change our life, leave the comfort zone though it is not easy. We can step out of the first step, think about what we want, and how to get it. We can set a goal and start to plan about it, take action, it will motivate us in the process. </p><p>Working and learning in the process of pursuing these goals, create an action plan for it. The action plan is what you need to do to achieve the goal you set, the requirement to get on your goal, and the difficult part to achieve it. Follow the plan and implement it step by step, bit by bit, this process can be very tough it depends on what you want. To keep in track of your plan and obtaining your goal,  you need to work on your plan consistently and get the result in the end. A lot of things that are not as a fast game, we are nothing working hard to get the things first but to keep the things lasting. Doing this over and over again is the personal evolutionary process.</p><p>Do the things simple, and repeat doing the simple things. Setting a goal is simple but important, we can have a clear image of what we want instead of doing everything that we think we should. Set a simple goal, get a hard result.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back then in 2016, I was working in Panasonic Senai as a software engineer, I got an opportunity to travel to Japan with a business trip. At that time I have just working in Panasonic Senai around 9 months, and one of the departments in our company just setting up a new system developed by Panasonic Japan members. By chance, I had been assigned to maintain this system and handle future enhancement. In order to handover the system, Japan members requested I to travel to Tokyo to meet them and they will handover all the information related to this system to me.</p><p>This is my first-time travel to Japan and Tokyo, I felt very excited to visit Tokyo since it is a prosperous city and the top fashion culture in Asia. I did a lot of research about it and planned my travel schedule and those places I wanted to visits. This business trip is around 6 days and I need to work from 9 am to 5 pm, but I still able to travel around after work. I work with Japan members in the Panasonic Tokyo office, it is a sales distribution center, that’s why it allocated in the Tokyo city in a huge office building. </p><p>My department head was with me for the first two days on this business trip, he brought me to having dinner with Japan members after work. We went to have some drinks, it is a Japanese Beer Buffet with snacks. After that, he leaves me alone to work with Japan members.      He guild me to learn how to take the train to the office from the hotel that we stay in, but I was once get lost when I went off from the office to the hotel. I’m using GPS and Google Maps but I still can’t find the way to the hotel, luckily I asked a Japanese to guild me back, I took one hour lost and back to the hotel that only needs 10 mins journey.</p><p>The Japan member treated me very well, he brought me to travel around after work, he guild me on how to go to the place I wanted to visits. They also bought me some lunch since the living cost in Tokyo is very high, a meal costs around 35 Ringgit Malaysia, it is very expensive for me since I’m just a fresh graduate with a low salary at that moment.</p><p>This is a very special experience for me,  I felt that Japan is very big different compare with Malaysia, the culture and the society are very unique and attractive.

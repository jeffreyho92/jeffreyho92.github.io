            <p>When you think about how you will become in the future, who you will be in the future, and you look at your present and future selves as two different people. What you need to do to become the person you desire to be, the things that you doing now will benefit your future self. This is an important question that we need to ask ourselves, it is essential for our self-growth and become a better person.</p>
<p>Visualize about the future negative consequences that your future self will experience, what skill is required to overcome these negative moments, it can be a positive mindset or mentally strong heart, experiencing more things will make us stronger. Keep trying new things and learn from it is the key, the more you know the more you realize you don’t know. Go through all the things that happened in our life, good things or bad things all are valuable. Taking responsibility when you screw up, admit our mistake is the first step to conquer it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that everything is a case study. Think about what it is a case of and what principles apply. - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Change only comes from taking action not just knowing about it. Every time we realize we need to do something for our future self, we need to take immediate action on it, I know sometimes it can be tough though.</p>
<p>The way you do anything is the way you do everything, we should start from a very tiny step on small things that can keep improving ourselves, it could be just a 5 mins exercise every day, but it will make a big impact in our life. Start building a new habit for future self, give them a healthy life, they will be grateful for us in taking these minor actions.</p>

            <p>Whenever something bad happened, it may make someone worst or there could be an opportunity for someone to get better. Everything has two sides, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Crisis entails opportunities, we should try to look at the other side to avoid bias, though it is not easy but doable.</p>
<p>During this pandemic, a lot of people start doing digital marketing, they saw other people are doing something, so they also want to follow the trend, but this fall into the herd mentality, people can be influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most adaptable to change. - Charles Darwin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should we follow other people doing the same things to avoid falling behind, or should we accommodate ourselves to adopt the new changes in the environment, I prefer the second one. When we follow the trend, doing the same things as other people doing, we are stuck in the 80% crowd, we can’t stand out in this situation. </p>
<p>The other option is don’t follow other people but improve ourselves to stay in the game, learning new skills that essential to survive in the environment. I think this is better than following other people back since we are growing with new experiences and it doesn’t hurt to trying new things. Even though step out of our comfort zone and overcome the challenges in a new environment is not easy, we are taking a risk and opening ourselves up to the possibility of stress, it will be tough but it is worth spending effort on it.</p>
<p>Even if I fail now, the skills I have acquiring will be valuable in the future, it will become my weapon to fight the next challenges.</p>

            <p>Sometimes we thought we have to be knowledgeable to become successful, but in fact, not all the professors or scientists they can achieve success in life, even though they study a lot. Sometimes we thought we need to be hardworking to become successful but in fact, most of the foreign workers can’t achieve success in life, even though they are very hardworking on their work.</p>
<p>When I look at a successful person who has some disadvantages, I’m thinking about how he or she can be successful with such defeats. They could be being rude or be emotional with someone, how they can achieve success with doing such bad things, why we being a good person but can’t achieve something in our life. Though I still suffering in this thinking, but I realized that no one is saying that being a good person definitely can be a success in life. We still need to put hard work on something that we really desired to achieve, being a good person is just a choice as a human, although it’s not easy being kind all the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real test is being kind to unkind people. - Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Successful people can be unkind people. Nobody is perfect, people can be successful in their careers but fail in personal life, people can be kind in their family but doesn’t look successful in other people’s perspectives.</p>
<p>Good person won’t necessarily to become successful. I think the point here is not about being a good person or a bad person. The point here is how we determine success, it could be a different thing in different people’s life. However, keep improving ourselves to become better is essential to become successful, nobody is keeping the worst to achieve success. Fortunately, life is not fair but it is still good.</p>

            <p>Everyone has opinions, either opinion from you to other people’s things, or opinions from other people that give you, it can be good or bad, neither all. Dealing with other people’s opinions can be tough since you don’t know that is good or bad for you, people may think it is good maybe it works for them, but actually, it can be bad for you.</p>
<p>When you dealing with the opinion that you don’t agree with and the person insists on giving you his opinion and want you to make a decision on it. At this point, opinion becomes troublesome, how to decline people’s opinion is like a martial art. We can’t straightaway reject the opinion, we need to handle it without affecting our relationship, we need to articulate our thoughts more clearly, and don’t be emotional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t treat all opinions as equally valuable - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the opinion that works on other people but may not works on our own. Learning how to recognize a good opinion it takes time to gain from experiences but it is an essential skill in our life. When we took the opinion and realized it is bad for us, the first time what we need to do is make a reflection on it, instead of blaming other people.</p>
<p>Don’t argue for other people’s opinions. Don’t argue for your own. When you make a mistake, admit it, correct it, and learn from it. We should get improve from other people’s opinions, rather than become worst from it. We can don’t follow the opinion if we thought it is not useful for us, it depends on different situations and the way you see it through.</p>
<p>Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. The opinion is thought from other people but implements on our own. We should take responsibility for it, think about the opinion with our personal situation, instead of following blindly. Don’t be in blind faith and avoid the herding effect.</p>

            <p>People keep moving forward with gaining new knowledge. Learning is the very first step of change, learning is just a small part of the puzzle, but it’s the most important part. Sometimes we feel hard to take the step out due to procrastination or lack of intention, or maybe we read it once then we thought we had learned about it, but this is not true.</p>
<p>As Alvin Toffler mentioned in his book, the 21st-century learning process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learn -&gt; Unlearn -&gt; Re-learn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learn: Getting the new things that we had never seen or known before, and take it as our knowledge.<br>Unlearn: After we learn the knowledge, it is open to objection. We should do some reflection on it, is it matching with our faith, should we agree with that point of view, we can be opposed to it.<br>Re-learn: After the reflection process, we re-learn the knowledge and come out with our own beliefs. This is such an important process that we can learn the knowledge that suite our past and future.</p>
<p>As Chris Do mention in his video, this is the new generation of the education process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Self-learning -&gt; Critical thinking -&gt; Articulation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self-learning: We can learn what we wanted to learn through searching Google, read a book, join an online course, subscript MOOC, or even learn from a stranger.<br>Critical thinking: After we learn the new thing, we start a debate on it, think about how it is work, and is it a reliable knowledge, and how we can use it in our own.<br>Articulation: After we process the new learning to become our knowledge, we share it with people around us, it can be written in a post or article, repeat thinking about the knowledge. We should speak out loud for sharing and it can strengthen our memory.</p>
<p>Learning is from an input, and processing becomes an output, we consume the knowledge we learn, reflect on it, and implement it in our life.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, we are used to enjoying doing small things and make it looks perfect since it is easy to get done and we can get the result response immediately, though, it is not interesting. People like to do things that are able to get immediate responses and feel easy to do it, like reply email or doing a small task, it lets us feel that we are doing something. However, it didn’t bring much value to our time.</p>
<p>Big things are something that not easy to achieve, it requires us to give hard work on it, and takes time to work on it to get some outcomes. Most of the time, we are procrastinating to work on the big things since it needs more effort, more focus, and consume more time on it. However, it will bring a huge effect on our life when we achieve it, it worth our time to spend on it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s more important to do big things well than to do small things perfectly. - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get things done and make life easy. I’m still learning to make the small things done but not make it perfect. Sometimes, when I doing the small things, I like to make it perfect and waste a lot of time in the details. Nevertheless, stop being a perfectionist is a good achievement.</p>
<p>Begin with the end in mind, Stephen Covey wrote in his book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. When we get started to do something, we can make a clear vision of the desired direction and destination, imaging the thing that had been completed, and how will it looks like. This action can give us some motivation to work on it and make things happen, done lately is better than no progress.</p>
<p>Value your time and waste your time in something that makes values in your life.</p>

            <p>Every human being has strengths and weaknesses, we should focus on our strengths or fix the weaknesses, this is a deep question in our life. Based-on the wood barrel theory, the shortest plank is way more important than the longest plank, you can’t bring more water with longer plank cause water will lacking from the shortest plank, this reflects as a weak point in a person. In most of the case, we can do a lot with our strengths but sometimes we will fail in our weaknesses. Thus, we have to admit it, highlighting them, diagnosing them, thinking about what should be done differently in the future, in order to fix the weaknesses.</p>
<p>You may feel that recognizing our weak point is not that easy process, we need to do the reflection on the mistake we did, understand the root cause, and admit on it. Finding out that you are wrong is even more valuable than being right because you are learning, you are fixing the shorter plank of your life.</p>
<p>Indeep, sometimes we had identified our weak point but we don’t know how to solve it, it will bring more stress altogether. However, when we understand the problem we have, we can look into it more details, start researching to find out the solution, read something that can enhance our mindset. When you realized you don’t know, means that you already know.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet fixing unacceptable problems is actually a lot easier than not fixing them, because not fixing them will make you miserable. - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly believe that we need to fix our weaknesses, try to improve a little bit on it and life will be better when we conquer it. Even though we can’t overcome our weak point in some cases, at least we can avoid it when we know what it is and do more things to cover it, it will be more beneficial than knowing nothing about it.</p>

            <p>I was often thinking about how to be a success in my career and what I need to do to achieve it. This question brings along with another question, what is a successful career and how can we measure it. I have a faith that as long as I keep learning and improving, I am in the direction of the place or position that I thought is a successful career. </p>
<p>However, sometimes I saw people around me who had been done some achievements or make more money than me at the same age, I just concerning how they can do it and what skill or attribute that requires for it. The more I think the more I realized that the important point is in their thinking patterns, they always think about what people want, not what they want to give. When we try to understand people and studying what is helpful for people, we provide our value to people and get success from it. </p>

<p>The direction of our target and knowing what we want is the most important things and it is essential for all of us. If we want to become a millionaire, we need to think like a millionaire and act like them so as to become one of them. I need to be clear about my goals, focus on the things I desire, and what is the required ability to achieve it. It will be a long journey but I feel very interested in it like an adventure.</p>

            <p>Every time I feel like want to prepare everything before getting started, doing a lot of research and planning, but sometimes not even start to do it. We are enjoying the moment of preparing, planning, imaging, getting ready, but we felt uninterested when start doing it.</p>
<p>Sometimes we are looking for a good plan to get ready, wanted to get a perfect job done, imaging the plan a hundred times in mind, but plan can’t keep up with changes. Sometimes experiences and the ability to deal with changes are more important than a perfect plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Principles. You don’t have to know everything to get what you want. You just have to be honest with yourself about what you don’t know and know who to ask for help. - Ray Dalio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think doing while learning is better than learning for doing. To be honest, I prefer practical knowledge compare with theoretical knowledge, I’m a practical person, I learned something from doing it not studying it, I felt like I can understand more in real-life hands-on experiences, instead of the theory of knowledge that learn from books. </p>
<p>Recognize the power of knowing how to deal with not knowing. The fast learner is better than a smart person. The fast learner can deal with a different situation and learn a new skill to overcome it. The smart person will fail when the situation is not good for him when he can’t deal with it, he does nothing.</p>
<p>Understand that the ability to deal with not knowing is for more powerful than knowing. We should not feel shame when we are not a smart person, we should feel shame when we can’t learn something from it and improve it, even though just a little bit. When we know the problem, we already solved half of the problem. </p>

            <p>Looking at feeling from a different angle and a different perspective can feel differently. Every feeling can be good or bad, especially for Pain, it depends on how you treat it.</p>
<p>Bad pain; allow pain to stand in the way of your progress, it makes you fail.<br>Good pain; understand how to manage the pain to produce progress with it.</p>
<p>Sometime happened something bad to you, you feel pain and uncomfortable, but we can see it as an experience. Sometimes you get criticism from people around you, you feel pain and hurt, but we can see it as an enlightened. Sometimes you face a failure, you feel pain and disappointment, but we can see it as an adventure. Those bad things make you feel pain but if you don’t learn from it, it will be more painful.</p>
<p>Instead of avoiding the pain to happen, we should focus on the reflection when the pain happened, we can think about how and why the things happen, swift to a different perspective, and learn from the pain.</p>
<p>Ray Dalio once wrote in his book Principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pain + Reflection = Progress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most learning comes from making mistakes and experiencing the pain of them. Looks into the pain is not easy, sometimes it is violated with our self-esteem, struggling with acceptance, and admit it is our false. </p>
<p>When you meet resistance, push through the pain of facing your problem, knowing you will end up in a much better place, it will bring you to overcome the resistance. Pain is like a wall that blocks us from moving forward and lets us feel safe behind it and stay in the comfort zone. Sometimes we need to be brave to pick it up and throw it behind.</p>
<p>Don’t waste the pain and make it worth to happen.</p>

<p>Knowledge is not power, it is potential power. Execution will trump knowledge any day - Tony Robbins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of people saying that knowledge is power, without knowledge we can’t do anything, but owning knowledge without action also do nothing. I have been too influenced by Knowledge, I enjoy learning new things but yet less execution. The necessity of taking action appropriately is more powerful than knowing knowledge.</p>
<p>How many people around you know a lot of things but do nothing about it? We regularly find out the issue but do not take any action to fix it. We used to ignore the issue since it is easier than find out the solution. As is told that knowledge without action is useless. We all know that we must take action but it is easier said than done.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that learning knowledge is useless. Action without knowledge is aimless, it may bring in more troubles, we can’t go somewhere we are not familiar with without a navigator. Nowadays we can learn everything from internal everywhere every time. Everyone can get knowledge, it is cheap without execution. Gaining knowledge and understanding is wisdom, it is the first step before taking action, it was a tool waiting to be used. However, missing out on the action leaves our knowledge worthless. </p>
<p>Learning how to swim from a swimming video doesn’t make us really can swim, it needs real practice and implementation. As reading provides knowledge, it also ensures that the necessary action needs to be taken. </p>
<p>Knowledge is like an ax, it needs someone to use it to cut down a tree. This making the idea a simple yet powerful weapon. </p>

            <p>In Japan, Ikigai is a concept of having a meaningful direction in life. It is a philosophy about finding a reason for being. It is about doing something you love and you are good at it, with the possibility of bringing value to other people. In most cases, Ikigai does not refer only to one’s purpose in life, without regard to others or society. It is captured by the Ikigai diagram and includes overlapping these spheres, Love, Good At, Paid For, and Needs.</p>
<p>This diagram helps us gain further insights into our purpose in life and seeking what we are enjoying to do.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ikigai.png" alt="Luck Surface Area" title="Ikigai"></p>
<p>What you love:<br>The things that bring us the most joy in life and make us feel fulfilled. It can a hobby, exercise, reading, or spending leisure time with people. The things do not matter whether we are good at it or we can get paid for doing it.  </p>
<p>What you are good at:<br>The skills you learned, talented, and be expert in. It can be sports, painting, or public speaking. However, it can also a thing that you are good at but you don’t like.</p>
<p>What the world needs:<br>The world here might be a small community or a global trending demand that people want. The world’s needs might include IT, engineering, medical, or innovation. This sphere involved other people and beyond people’s needs.</p>
<p>What you can get paid for:<br>This is related to the things that people talented at but it getting lower paid. It might be singing or passionate about art. Whether it can get higher paid depended on the demand.</p>
<p>There is further meaning that overlapping spheres in the diagram.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Good At + Love = Passion<br>Love + Needs = Mission<br>Needs + Paid For = Vocation<br>Paid For + Good At = Profession</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The best spot within this Ikigai diagram would involve every point together. I am passionate about programming, am also skilled at it, there is a need for it in my world at the time, and I have an enjoyable job in this field with well paid. I would say I have found my Ikigai for my life.</p>
<p>When you love your job, it is not a job anymore.</p>

<p>You should take the approach that you’re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong. - Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Elon Musk said, being wrong or failed is always an option because if you are not, means you are not improving.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes, and we do it regularly without noticing it. No one enjoys being wrong, it is a negative emotional experience for all of us. The important thing is how do we respond when it happened to us. Some people will take responsibility and address it quickly. Some people will feel embarrassing to admit their mistake. Some people stubbornly denying being wrong and escape from the failure. People’s egos and emotions will make thing goes worth even they know it is wrong, it is hard to control the emotions.</p>
<p>Don’t try to shift the blame to other people. Other people might make mistakes or do wrong things with us, but we should focus only on our part. We should not argue that the mistake is caused by others. Even if they don’t admit it, but we know that we did the right thing by admitting our wrongs.</p>
<p>We all know admitting we are wrong is a virtue and having this habit will benefit us in our life. Struggling to admit our fault can harm our interpersonal relationship. Admitting we are wrong doesn’t mean that we are a loser. In fact, being able to own up to our mistakes takes a lot of courage and self-awareness. It is a sign of improvement. People won’t consider us a bad guy instead, they would probably respect our guts and sincerity.</p>
<p>After admitting and owning the mistake, we should do reflection, walking through the mistake, and learn from it provided we don’t repeat the same mistakes. The ability to fail, learn something new, and then find a solution until it works.</p>

<p>Hard skills are skills where the rules stay the same regardless of which company, circumstance, or people you work with. In contrast, soft skills are skills where the rules changes depending on the company culture and people you work with. - Lei Han</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard skills are measurable and most often technical skills, such as accounting and engineering. Soft skills are intangible and difficult to quantify, such as leadership and communication.</p>
<p>In work, hard skills help us to make confident decisions, but they do not help the foundation of communication and interaction with people around us. Business is not a machine, it is groups of people working together to achieve something.</p>
<p>LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner says “interpersonal skills are where we’re seeing the biggest imbalance. Communications is the number one skills gap”. LinkedIn’s 2018 Workforce Report found that the four most in-demand soft skills are leadership, communication, collaboration, and time management. </p>
<p>Soft skills can be very hard to learn since it required an internal mind change. There is some debate about the importance of soft skills and hard skills that affect work or life. However, they are both necessary and equivalent to one another.</p>
<p>Soft skills often provide the foundation for high emotional intelligence (EQ). EQ is the ability to identify and manage our emotions, and also the ability to understand one’s emotions. When Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is related to technical skills, EQ accounts for 90% of what makes people move up the success ladder.</p>
<p>Mind-body awareness is an important soft skill. It helps us from reading the room and reading others before we are consciously aware of them. Mind-body practices such as yoga and meditation help us monitor ourselves and understand our mind. This kind of self-awareness also increases empathy. Empathy is useful in work or life. Think the way of others, put ourselves in one’s shoes, help us understand more in the circumstance, and control our emotions. Such habits allow us to engage more deeply with other people.</p>
<p>Focus on improving soft skills such as listening and empathy with a growth mindset that will bring us an unfair advantage in work and life.</p>

            <p>A high-income skill is a skill that you be able to leverage to get more paid. It’s often a soft skill than a hard skill. Like communication, passion, or reliability. It delivers a unique value to your organization and allows you to control your salary because you will be in high demand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your income right now is a result of your standards, it is not the industry, it is not the economy. - Tony Robbins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don’t always achieve your goals but you always improve your standard by doing it. To develop high-income skills, you need to increase your confidence with body language and communicate in the same ways as high earners. From the organization to the family, unclear communication can mess up everything. High-income earners consistently rate clear communication as an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>People who earn a high income drives every decision with their passion. When we living our life with passion, we living life instead of working a job.  We can find meaning in our work instead of just looking for the salary. A job can be a larger life strategy. High earners plan on how to leverage the existing resources they currently have to generate more income, this is the most powerful high-income skill.</p>
<p>Believe in the impossible is simply telling ourselves we can do it. At the end of the day, we won’t try the impossible if we don’t think there is a chance of success. In every moment, imagine that you are a high earner, what will you do in the current situation, learn a new skill to solve the problem if necessary. </p>
<p>As Tony Robbins said, “Who you spend time with is who you become.” Surround ourselves with the right people is the most important thing. A negative environment can’t make us think positive. Successful people know the power of networking, they surround themselves with people they wanted to become. Find people who achieved what we want, figure out how they did it, and modeling them. </p>

            <p>Nowadays we are no longer demographics, we are psychographic. People living in the same area may have different interests or lifestyle. In the words of motivational speaker, Vusi Thembekwayo: “A kid living in Kuala Lumpur who has never been out of Kuala Lumpur sounds like a kid in Brooklyn New York because he watches Jay Z on Youtube. So he is completely immersed in that culture even though he never left his small little village.” No matter where we are, what we watch or read might change our identity. We will get influenced by those things we are interested in.</p>
<p>We often heard that “You are the average of the five people spend the most time with”. The people around you may shape who you are. When we are talking to a negative person, we will be affected by negative mindsets. When we are surrounded by people who love to talk about business, we will learn the knowledge of the business from them. People of a mind fall into the same group.</p>
<p>Successful people pay attention to networking. They care about who they spend time with and how people affected them. They proactively surround by people who more successful than themselves, so they can learn from them and keep improving. It is the key to have a growth mindset, which can be influenced by other people.</p>
<p>Surround with successful people may help you become successful. You might discover something from successful people in your subconscious mind without notice it. You might learn from their mindset, follow their way of thinking, and wanted to achieve success as them.</p>
<p>Hang out with people who inspire you to become better. Research for people you wanted to be an inspiration, learn from what they have done, and model them.</p>

            <p>As an easy definition, the Law of Attraction is the belief that positive thoughts will bring positive experiences. It uses the power of our mind to translate whatever is in our thoughts and materialize them into reality. Simply put, all thoughts will turn into things eventually. If you think about negative things you will remain under that cloud. If you think about positive thoughts you will find a way to achieve them with action. We are acting as human magnets sending out our thoughts and emotions and attracting back more of what we have put out.</p>
<p>Many people think that the Law of Attraction is just visualizing what we want and wait for it to come. However, this is unreasonable. I think that is not exactly how it works. There is something missing in the idea, no matter how much time and effort we put into visualizing our success, all we will ever be is a person with a dream. As they said, we can’t have the things that we never had until we do the things that we have never done. We can’t do the same thing but expecting different results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dreams don’t work unless you take action. - Roy T. Bennett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to use the power of the Law of Attraction and make our dreams come true, there is one key ingredient we must integrate into our life: ACTION. Visualization and internal work are important but that doesn’t mean we can ignore the action step altogether. Once we have the inner work to get clear on mind, the action work comes far more easily. We have to take action and take all of the required steps to make our vision a reality. </p>
<p>As soon as we start to activate the Law of Attraction and gain more traction, it will be much easy to focus on positive things, ignore negative things, and achieve our goals.</p>

            <p>Everything is different nowadays, distraction is everywhere and happened anytime. There are so many things that distracted our attention and took away our time. We take our smartphones with us everywhere we go, we spend a lot of time on social media, messages, and news. We got distracted more often than we’d like. The reason why we got it is one of the biggest secrets that most tech-companies don’t want us to know.</p>
<p>Dopamine Hacking. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dopamine is a neurochemical which is released every time your brain anticipates a reward such as entertainment, information, novelty, or stimulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When dopamine is released, it makes us feel good, so our brain wants more of it. Just like a fat kid who loves chocolate cake. This is why our brain will stimulate us to repeat the behaviors that led to a dopamine release.</p>
<p>Common distractions such as social media, news, and even email have been intentionally designed to trigger an incredibly strong dopamine release. It is much more dopamine release than most of our work does. It is purposely chosen by the companies behind the apps. In fact, their entire business model depends on it. The stronger the dopamine release, the more time we will spend on these distractions, and the more money they make.</p>
<p>This is a concept called “attention-hacking”. It happened when we want to do something that matters most at the time like reading or study. We got distracted from our smartphone, it gave us an immediate response with dopamine release, we got addicted to it as we felt happy and enjoyable. It’s quickly destroying people’s ability to stay focused. Our brain is being hijacked by meaningless things, and it prevents us from working on meaningful things.</p>
<p>When we understand this concept, we will be able to easily block distractions in our daily life and allow us to focus deeply on things that truly matter.</p>

            <p>What is the key to success that they have picked up, but we can’t do it and even can’t see it. Success looks like a gift given to other people but not us. Why their success seems like effortless. </p>
<p>Success does not always based-on luck, it comes from hard work. If we are hungry enough, we put our effort to find a way to achieve success, with all in. We surround ourselves with the right people who managed to achieve something that we are looking for. It means surrounding the mindset of a winner and always tempting to achieve more. We can model their strategy.</p>
<p>Modeling means learning by following the behavior of other people. Humans naturally model each other, like children modeling their parents, follow what their parents do. Modeling is a technique used by those who willing to learn from other people. People who do modeling have a growth mindset. Those people believe that just as we learn behaviors, we can learn from the experiences of successful people. </p>
<p>Modeling also happens in the organization. The staff could be modeling his manager in doing some tasks, and often modeling is unintentional. Company culture is also a model that lead by the leaders in the organization, everyone modeling the culture involuntary.</p>
<p>Modeling in psychology has become a mainstream theory. Whether in career or life, select a person you admire to become, study the methodology behind their success, learn from their strategy, and follow the similar path to achieve it. Look for someone who already achieves the things that you wanted to do or someone who has created the kind of life that you want to live. Look into their history, what kind of difficulties they face, and how they overcome. Use their experiences to build a path to mirrors theirs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Success Leaves Clues - Tony Robbins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most successful people have the similar strategy that we can be modeling it. Modeling is a skill set that we can learn and keep improving on it.</p>

            <p>First-principles thinking is one of the best ways of reverse engineering for complicated problems. The idea is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the group up.  First-principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world. This way of thinking helps us removes the common assumptions that might be wrong, also knowns as Cognitive Bias.</p>
<p>Most of the time, people are reasoning by analogy. We look at something that was done before or something else that other people are doing it. A lot of things that we believe are based on some authority figure telling us that is true. As children, we learn to stop questioning when we are told “Because I said so.” As adults, we learn to stop questioning when people say “Because that’s how it works.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. - Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Children instinctively think in first principles. They like to ask “Why” until they understand the thing. However, audits will always think that we are doing this because it is always been done that way. We are not doing it because nobody else ever done that, so it must not be good. But this is just a lazy way of thinking. We have to build up the reasoning from the group up. We can try to understand the reality with what is true, not with our intuition.  If we let other people think for us means that we are using their analogies or their experiences. People’s thinking is framed by someone else and it could be wrong.</p>
<p>The power of first-principles thinking is not only for improvement but also increases the possibility. Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of conventional wisdom. We can reason by first principles, by analogy, or a blend of the two.</p>

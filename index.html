            <p>According to research, most people are most efficient during the first two hours of the morning. The morning is often the peak time of productivity. Most people tend to be energetic, focused, and clear-minded. The disciplined people use the morning time to knock down the one most high-impact task that is the most complex and intimidating.</p>
<p>There are several key benefits to starting our most important task early in the morning. Firstly, when we completed the most energy-draining task in the day, the rest of the day feels like fulfilled. The day is pretty much a big success before the afternoon. Secondly, the use of this rule can prevent us from delaying the tasks that have the greatest impact on our goals and make the most progress.</p>
<p>Usually, we tend to delay on important tasks because these tasks are very complex and energy-consuming. They are always put off until tomorrow and the future. However, if we try to set at least one priority before the afternoon, we can no longer procrastinate on the tasks anymore.</p>
<p>Because the most important tasks require our 100% attention, it is good practice to use the morning peak hours to complete one of the tasks instead of doing paperwork, replying to messages, or answering emails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to get the most out of your day, do your most important work “your one thing” early. - Gary Keller</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I try my best to make full use of the peak hours in the morning to complete the most important task of the day. At this moment, my mind is the clearest, my attention is the most concentrated, and mental clarity. When I try to do this in the afternoon, I just struggle to stay focused and it requires more energy consumption.</p>
<p>After completing the high-impact tasks before the afternoon, I gain a sense of accomplishment and motivation for the rest of the day.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, people are going to cultivate the habit of celebrating busyness. Most people are proud of being busy, just like having an honor badge on it. People think as long as we are doing a lot of things mean that we can expect to achieve success. I think it is interesting to see how some people block the productivity they seek. Those who aggressively run around all day to be the busiest, which is usually rewarded with compliments and promotion. </p>
<p>However, I think this is the wrong thing to be proud of and nothing to celebrate. Being busy does not mean being productive. Being busy has nothing to do with bringing in value. People who are busy running around all day have nothing to do with making progress towards the most important tasks. Busy is often the smokescreen for real productivity. As author Tim Kreider said, “Yes, I know we are all very busy, but what, exactly, is getting done?”</p>
<p>The busier we are, the less energy, attention, and time we have to do those high-impact tasks that can truly move the needle. Therefore, being busy will keep us away from the success we are looking for. In fact, there are only a few things that truly matter. We need to be aware of these priorities, protect our time and save our energy for them. We should concentrate on doing high-impact tasks as much as possible. Less contribution, busywork is just distracting. It takes away our valuable time, attention, and energy from the few really important tasks. </p>
<p>In a word, we should stop “acting busy” and stop celebrating it. Alternatively, we should honor those who cut out the busywork and focus their resources on the high-impact tasks that move the needle.</p>
<p>Productive means doing less but focusing on the most important tasks.</p>

            <p>Most people fail to develop a new habit most of the time. One of the most common mistakes is that people intend to build a strong habit and start from a difficult task. It is a bit like going to the gym for the first time and trying to lift the heaviest weights. This is not the best way to start exercising. Most people understand that we need to build our strength from our present level. This concept applies to forming any new habits.</p>
<p>Start from small with the initial habit. When we want to get into the habit of exercise every day, don’t expect to start from the hardest and exhaust ourselves. If we start from a high standard such as workout for two hours every day, we will feel too hard to achieve and can’t maintain consistently.<br>Exercise for two hours every day is a great obstacle, which we can’t overcome if we don’t accumulate strength.</p>
<p>When we start to build a new habit, the most important thing is not about the task, it’s about building the habit of getting ourselves to do the task. Once we get into the habit of letting ourselves do the task, then we can focus on increasing the intensity or increase the time of the task. Therefore, in the beginning, we should make the obstacle as low as possible, so that it’s easier and non-intimidating. </p>
<p>Instead of doing two-hour straight, we could start with a 15-minute routine, and then increase it slowly. Even when we feel tired or lazy, it can be done. In other words, the lower barrier, the higher success rate, and a higher success rate, the greater the achievement.</p>
<p>Starting from a small place and increasing the load over time goes by is the most sustainable way to build a new habit, so that we can become unstoppable.</p>

            <p>In a day, we all have a short period of natural time, during which time we will feel the most energetic and awake.</p>
<p>It is called peak energy time. It can be in the early morning or late at night. During the peak energy time, we tend to have better attention and concentration, clear thinking, and less distraction. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your internal prime time is the time of day, according to your body clock, when you are the most alert and productive. - Brian Tracy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we are in our peak energy time, it will be more efficient and productive. It is wise to spend time on our high-impact and complex tasks. Unfortunately, most people are not aware of their peak energy time, which leads to inefficient use of their time. Most people waste their peak energy time by working on low-impact tasks instead of high-impact tasks. It means we need to work more hours to have the same level as leverages the peak energy time. It is like fighting an unnecessary hard battle. </p>
<p>According to the research, most people have peak energy time in the morning. My peak energy time is between 9 AM and 12 PM which is why I enjoy doing my deep work in those hours. During the afternoon, I often lose energy, and then I use this time to do some low-impact tasks such as checking emails. For me, trying to concentrate on my work in the afternoon is usually the prescription for disaster. However, in my peak energized morning, it is very easy to concentrate. Of course, everyone has their own peak energy time. It could be at night or midnight.</p>
<p>Understand our peak energy time and use it to improve our productivity. Use it to complete the most complicated tasks, which require all our energy and cognitive resources. This is how we work wisely.</p>

            <p>Sometimes I wonder why some people are able to achieve so many things, and how they can do them in such a short time? I found a common idea after doing some research. The most productive people do not necessarily work much more than others around them. In fact, sometimes it even takes less than 40 hours a week to work. Instead of working more time, they give priority to their works and work smarter. Instead of working more hours, they prioritize their works and working smarter. They focus on maximizing their working hours, instead of “acting busy”. This is how they can achieve better results in the same period or even in a shorter period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people who achieve extraordinary results don’t achieve them by working more hours. They achieve them by getting more done in the hours they work. - Gary Keller</p>

<p>Deep work is one of the ways to get the maximum effect from our working time.<br>Practicing deep work is when we work on our Most Valuable Task (MVT) in a “Flow State”. The most valuable tasks are the task that can contribute the greatest advantage, progress, and benefits much more than other tasks. When we work on the most impact task simultaneously in a Flow State ensures we fully use our brain on this one task which allows us to complete it faster. Four hours’ working time is equivalent to ten hours’ normal working time. Generally speaking, this is one of the secrets to maximize our productivity and achievement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work. - Cal Newport</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we do something with Deep Work which feels like a superpower. It is a very important skill in the world that becoming more and more distracting. Therefore, as a point of action, we can start practicing Deep Work in a 90-minute time. Choose one of the Most Valuable Tasks and take 90 minutes to finish it without smartphone, social media, or things that interfere with our Flow State.</p>

<p>The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one - Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This advice is simple but strong, it contains many ideas. Most of the time, when we have a big idea, we get excited about it. However, it is so difficult when we want to work on it, it is so complicated until we didn’t manage to get the start. One of the most common reasons why we tend to procrastinate is because our tasks are overwhelming, complex, or require a long-term effort.</p>
<p>Although, by breaking down a complex idea into some small, manageable tasks, it loses its complexity and becomes much less intimidating. After that, we can get start the simplest and most specific task, and finish it. Then, we continue to the next task, and the next one goes out. This helps us to have a clear list of things we want to do. Simply repeating this process over and over again can help us achieve the bigger ideas, projects, or goals that we are aiming for. And this is the essence of Mark Twain’s advice, small daily actions compounded over time lead to big<br>results.</p>
<p>Want to start working out? That’s great. But it is overwhelming and intimidating. To avoid procrastinating on the complex goal, break it down into a list of small daily tasks, to have an idea of the progress. For example, start with a short time, but keep doing it every day, and then slowly increase the time when we are used to it. Through every small and manageable daily action we accomplish, we are one step closer to achieving this big and ambitious goal.</p>
<p>Whenever you want to procrastinate, just remember, just take one small step and finish it. There is no harm in doing a small task, at least there is a little progress on it.</p>

            <p>Most of the time people will ignore soft skills and focus on improving technical skills. People think soft skills are not easy to learn or we can’t improve them. However, we should treat soft skills the same way we would any technical skills.</p>
<p>First, where should we start? Think about our current job and the next job we are wanted to go for. What are the skills do successful people in those jobs have? Does the job involve communication with other types of people, technical and non-technical? Does having strong communication skills will benefit it?</p>
<p>Think about the last time we exercised the skill. Were we having any problems with communication? Are we able to convince other people about our idea? I’m pretty sure we must have some bad experiences when we talking to people or colleagues. Where we fell short and what we can do to get better next time. </p>
<p>We can do some research such as how to convince people about your idea, or how to make people want to listen to you. There are a ton of techniques that we can learn and practice with our coworkers or family members, even strangers. Try to push ourselves outside of our comfort zone. It does not hurt to try something new. Get comfortable with failure and keep improving and listen to feedback.</p>
<p>Seeking feedback makes us stronger. If someone does not like our idea, ask why and try to understand where they are coming from and what are their expectation. Sometimes an outside perspective can help us identify and understand our weaknesses. Positive and negative feedback both are important. It might be hurt at first, but we will learn faster than we do alone. </p>
<p>Whatever we do, make it a habit. Work on it and make a little improvement every day. </p>

            <p>When we learned how to communicate, we start to cooperate as human beings. Communication is the process of sending and receiving messages between more than one person. Communication is the glue that holds organized people together. It is a way for us to connect with each other, exchange ideas, and learn from others.</p>
<p>First of all, people spread information or knowledge among people through communication. Teachers share their knowledge with their students, parents share their culture with their children, colleagues discuss their works with each other, companies exchange information with their customers, the list goes on and on. I believe that the importance of communication is like breathing, and humans can’t live without it. Without communication, the knowledge process can’t work, companies can’t operate, and humans can’t build relationships and keep together.</p>
<p>Communication is the basis of human relations. At first, strangers begin to talk and getting to know each other, and then more interaction will bring closer relations. Interaction helps us to express our feelings and understand each other’s emotions and thoughts. However, it will generate hatred toward other people as well, negative or positive relationships will be created.</p>
<p>We need someone who can communicate! I often head this sentence from the professional recruiters or business areas. In fact that it is not meaningless. The research found out that, communication and interpersonal skills remain at the top of the list of what matters most to recruiters and corporations.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that communication is a very important and necessary skill in human life. It does not only help to develop relationships with others but also helpful to the process of sharing knowledge and information. Every day, we have to communicate with many different people, such as families or friends, and even strangers. We should effectively improve our communication to make our life better.</p>

            <p>In IT, we pretend that everyone else understands our product and know how to use it. You can have the best tools in the world, but if no one uses them, it doesn’t matter. This tends to be a problem across the board in the IT area. Even if this happens in other fields related to IT, such as security and operations. If we can’t even get all of the tech people on the same phase, it will be harder to get other people on board like marketing and business. Because of that, technical skills alone aren’t enough to be effective. We need to let other people be able to understand our idea. We need to be able to communicate to let people know what the problem is, and what solution we are providing, and why it is necessary.</p>
<p>The same policies apply across technology functions. If people see our product as a roadblock, if the tools require more works to them, they don’t want to use it. That’s why soft skills are important, it is the key to success in tech career, not only hard skills are required. If we can communicate with those different types of people, we will be much better at our job, no matter what type of job we are working on.</p>
<p>In order to get improve in soft skills. Treat soft skills the same way as we would any technical skills. Communication skills are likely to be listed as ‘soft’ but that does not mean they are easy to learn or acquire. Sometimes soft skill is easy to get started but it is hard to become expert. Although it is difficult to be an expert in this field, it is still possible for us to improve on our soft skills.</p>

            <p>Knowing how to ask a question is the art of conversation. Socrates’ most meaningful thought is also known as Socratic Questioning. For example, rather than the student receiving the teacher filling the mind to them, both are responsible for pushing the conversation forward. There are two ways of communication to improve the student learning from the teacher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know you won’t believe me, but the highest form of human excellence is to question oneself and others - Socrates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Socratic questioning usually having attributes as below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Concise, directed, and clear: The attention remains on the other person and should avoid complicated meaning. In order to reduce confusion, we should ask a question directly without too much retouching the sentence.</li>
<li>Open, yet with purpose:  Asking a meaningful question to increase the engagement of the person. There is a clear intention to make the other invited party actively participate.</li>
<li>Focused but tentative: The point is on the discussion, focusing on the issue, not the person. Asking questions on the point but yet does not assume the other person has the answer.</li>
<li>Neutral: The questioning must be pointed to the person’s perspective to get their opinion. It should not include or suggest the preferred answer. It does not guide the conversation to follow your opinion.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can manage the timing in the conversation. Allow time for the other person to respond to the questions without feeling hurried. Let the person think about your question, so we can get the true deep thought. </p>
<p>Regularly summarize what has been said. Let all the people understand what had been discussing and the whole idea in the conversation. Invite people to explain their idea, and bring about self-discovery through questioning. Keep the conversation focused, specific, and clearly worded.</p>
<p>According to science and research has confirmed that Socratic questioning provides students with positive support in enhancing critical thinking skills.</p>

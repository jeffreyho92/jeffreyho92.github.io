            <p>Most of the time people will ignore soft skills and focus on improving technical skills. People think soft skills are not easy to learn or we can’t improve them. However, we should treat soft skills the same way we would any technical skills.</p>
<p>First, where should we start? Think about our current job and the next job we are wanted to go for. What are the skills do successful people in those jobs have? Does the job involve communication with other types of people, technical and non-technical? Does having strong communication skills will benefit it?</p>
<p>Think about the last time we exercised the skill. Were we having any problems with communication? Are we able to convince other people about our idea? I’m pretty sure we must have some bad experiences when we talking to people or colleagues. Where we fell short and what we can do to get better next time. </p>
<p>We can do some research such as how to convince people about your idea, or how to make people want to listen to you. There are a ton of techniques that we can learn and practice with our coworkers or family members, even strangers. Try to push ourselves outside of our comfort zone. It does not hurt to try something new. Get comfortable with failure and keep improving and listen to feedback.</p>
<p>Seeking feedback makes us stronger. If someone does not like our idea, ask why and try to understand where they are coming from and what are their expectation. Sometimes an outside perspective can help us identify and understand our weaknesses. Positive and negative feedback both are important. It might be hurt at first, but we will learn faster than we do alone. </p>
<p>Whatever we do, make it a habit. Work on it and make a little improvement every day. </p>

            <p>When we learned how to communicate, we start to cooperate as human beings. Communication is the process of sending and receiving messages between more than one person. Communication is the glue that holds organized people together. It is a way for us to connect with each other, exchange ideas, and learn from others.</p>
<p>First of all, people spread information or knowledge among people through communication. Teachers share their knowledge with their students, parents share their culture with their children, colleagues discuss their works with each other, companies exchange information with their customers, the list goes on and on. I believe that the importance of communication is like breathing, and humans can’t live without it. Without communication, the knowledge process can’t work, companies can’t operate, and humans can’t build relationships and keep together.</p>
<p>Communication is the basis of human relations. At first, strangers begin to talk and getting to know each other, and then more interaction will bring closer relations. Interaction helps us to express our feelings and understand each other’s emotions and thoughts. However, it will generate hatred toward other people as well, negative or positive relationships will be created.</p>
<p>We need someone who can communicate! I often head this sentence from the professional recruiters or business areas. In fact that it is not meaningless. The research found out that, communication and interpersonal skills remain at the top of the list of what matters most to recruiters and corporations.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that communication is a very important and necessary skill in human life. It does not only help to develop relationships with others but also helpful to the process of sharing knowledge and information. Every day, we have to communicate with many different people, such as families or friends, and even strangers. We should effectively improve our communication to make our life better.</p>

            <p>In IT, we pretend that everyone else understands our product and know how to use it. You can have the best tools in the world, but if no one uses them, it doesn’t matter. This tends to be a problem across the board in the IT area. Even if this happens in other fields related to IT, such as security and operations. If we can’t even get all of the tech people on the same phase, it will be harder to get other people on board like marketing and business. Because of that, technical skills alone aren’t enough to be effective. We need to let other people be able to understand our idea. We need to be able to communicate to let people know what the problem is, and what solution we are providing, and why it is necessary.</p>
<p>The same policies apply across technology functions. If people see our product as a roadblock, if the tools require more works to them, they don’t want to use it. That’s why soft skills are important, it is the key to success in tech career, not only hard skills are required. If we can communicate with those different types of people, we will be much better at our job, no matter what type of job we are working on.</p>
<p>In order to get improve in soft skills. Treat soft skills the same way as we would any technical skills. Communication skills are likely to be listed as ‘soft’ but that does not mean they are easy to learn or acquire. Sometimes soft skill is easy to get started but it is hard to become expert. Although it is difficult to be an expert in this field, it is still possible for us to improve on our soft skills.</p>

            <p>Knowing how to ask a question is the art of conversation. Socrates’ most meaningful thought is also known as Socratic Questioning. For example, rather than the student receiving the teacher filling the mind to them, both are responsible for pushing the conversation forward. There are two ways of communication to improve the student learning from the teacher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know you won’t believe me, but the highest form of human excellence is to question oneself and others - Socrates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Socratic questioning usually having attributes as below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Concise, directed, and clear: The attention remains on the other person and should avoid complicated meaning. In order to reduce confusion, we should ask a question directly without too much retouching the sentence.</li>
<li>Open, yet with purpose:  Asking a meaningful question to increase the engagement of the person. There is a clear intention to make the other invited party actively participate.</li>
<li>Focused but tentative: The point is on the discussion, focusing on the issue, not the person. Asking questions on the point but yet does not assume the other person has the answer.</li>
<li>Neutral: The questioning must be pointed to the person’s perspective to get their opinion. It should not include or suggest the preferred answer. It does not guide the conversation to follow your opinion.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can manage the timing in the conversation. Allow time for the other person to respond to the questions without feeling hurried. Let the person think about your question, so we can get the true deep thought. </p>
<p>Regularly summarize what has been said. Let all the people understand what had been discussing and the whole idea in the conversation. Invite people to explain their idea, and bring about self-discovery through questioning. Keep the conversation focused, specific, and clearly worded.</p>
<p>According to science and research has confirmed that Socratic questioning provides students with positive support in enhancing critical thinking skills.</p>

            <p>We already hear people say something doesn’t work since nobody does the thing this way. We didn’t find out why we can’t do it, because of physical limitations or it is just something we can improve, but no one was doing it. We already got biased with convention or analogy to prior experiences. We are too used to think in an old way based-on previous experience since it’s always been done that way. However, we can try to think of something on a first-principles basis, that’s used in physics. We should look at the fundamentals and construct our reasoning from that, and then see if we have a conclusion that works, and it may be different from what people have done before.</p>
<p>Reasoning from first principles removes the assumptions and conventions. What remains is the essentials. It is a mental model we can use to improve our thinking because the essentials allow us to see where reasoning by analogy might lead to biases. The idea is to break down complicated problems into fundamental elements and then reassemble them from the ground up. This is one of the best ways to learn how to think about everything and also different perspectives that we miss.</p>
<p>This can happen in sports as well. A normal coach does what has already been done, and maybe he adds some tweaks, but he is just copying something that someone created before. But a good coach knows what he can and can’t do. He understands how he loses a game and how to improve on it. Everything is possible as long as it is not against the rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we never learn to take something apart, test the assumptions, and reconstruct it, we end up trapped in what other people tell us — trapped in the way things have always been done. When the environment changes, we just continue as if things were the same.</p>

<p>Knowledge is not power, it is potential power. Execution will trump knowledge any day - Tony Robbins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of people saying that knowledge is power, without knowledge we can’t do anything, but owning knowledge without action also do nothing. I have been too influenced by Knowledge, I enjoy learning new things but yet less execution. The necessity of taking action appropriately is more powerful than knowing knowledge.</p>
<p>How many people around you know a lot of things but do nothing about it? We regularly find out the issue but do not take any action to fix it. We used to ignore the issue since it is easier than find out the solution. As is told that knowledge without action is useless. We all know that we must take action but it is easier said than done.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that learning knowledge is useless. Action without knowledge is aimless, it may bring in more troubles, we can’t go somewhere we are not familiar with without a navigator. Nowadays we can learn everything from internal everywhere every time. Everyone can get knowledge, it is cheap without execution. Gaining knowledge and understanding is wisdom, it is the first step before taking action, it was a tool waiting to be used. However, missing out on the action leaves our knowledge worthless. </p>
<p>Learning how to swim from a swimming video doesn’t make us really can swim, it needs real practice and implementation. As reading provides knowledge, it also ensures that the necessary action needs to be taken. </p>
<p>Knowledge is like an ax, it needs someone to use it to cut down a tree. This making the idea a simple yet powerful weapon. </p>

            <p>In Japan, Ikigai is a concept of having a meaningful direction in life. It is a philosophy about finding a reason for being. It is about doing something you love and you are good at it, with the possibility of bringing value to other people. In most cases, Ikigai does not refer only to one’s purpose in life, without regard to others or society. It is captured by the Ikigai diagram and includes overlapping these spheres, Love, Good At, Paid For, and Needs.</p>
<p>This diagram helps us gain further insights into our purpose in life and seeking what we are enjoying to do.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ikigai.png" alt="Luck Surface Area" title="Ikigai"></p>
<p>What you love:<br>The things that bring us the most joy in life and make us feel fulfilled. It can a hobby, exercise, reading, or spending leisure time with people. The things do not matter whether we are good at it or we can get paid for doing it.  </p>
<p>What you are good at:<br>The skills you learned, talented, and be expert in. It can be sports, painting, or public speaking. However, it can also a thing that you are good at but you don’t like.</p>
<p>What the world needs:<br>The world here might be a small community or a global trending demand that people want. The world’s needs might include IT, engineering, medical, or innovation. This sphere involved other people and beyond people’s needs.</p>
<p>What you can get paid for:<br>This is related to the things that people talented at but it getting lower paid. It might be singing or passionate about art. Whether it can get higher paid depended on the demand.</p>
<p>There is further meaning that overlapping spheres in the diagram.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Good At + Love = Passion<br>Love + Needs = Mission<br>Needs + Paid For = Vocation<br>Paid For + Good At = Profession</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The best spot within this Ikigai diagram would involve every point together. I am passionate about programming, am also skilled at it, there is a need for it in my world at the time, and I have an enjoyable job in this field with well paid. I would say I have found my Ikigai for my life.</p>
<p>When you love your job, it is not a job anymore.</p>

<p>You should take the approach that you’re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong. - Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Elon Musk said, being wrong or failed is always an option because if you are not, means you are not improving.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes, and we do it regularly without noticing it. No one enjoys being wrong, it is a negative emotional experience for all of us. The important thing is how do we respond when it happened to us. Some people will take responsibility and address it quickly. Some people will feel embarrassing to admit their mistake. Some people stubbornly denying being wrong and escape from the failure. People’s egos and emotions will make thing goes worth even they know it is wrong, it is hard to control the emotions.</p>
<p>Don’t try to shift the blame to other people. Other people might make mistakes or do wrong things with us, but we should focus only on our part. We should not argue that the mistake is caused by others. Even if they don’t admit it, but we know that we did the right thing by admitting our wrongs.</p>
<p>We all know admitting we are wrong is a virtue and having this habit will benefit us in our life. Struggling to admit our fault can harm our interpersonal relationship. Admitting we are wrong doesn’t mean that we are a loser. In fact, being able to own up to our mistakes takes a lot of courage and self-awareness. It is a sign of improvement. People won’t consider us a bad guy instead, they would probably respect our guts and sincerity.</p>
<p>After admitting and owning the mistake, we should do reflection, walking through the mistake, and learn from it provided we don’t repeat the same mistakes. The ability to fail, learn something new, and then find a solution until it works.</p>

<p>Hard skills are skills where the rules stay the same regardless of which company, circumstance, or people you work with. In contrast, soft skills are skills where the rules changes depending on the company culture and people you work with. - Lei Han</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard skills are measurable and most often technical skills, such as accounting and engineering. Soft skills are intangible and difficult to quantify, such as leadership and communication.</p>
<p>In work, hard skills help us to make confident decisions, but they do not help the foundation of communication and interaction with people around us. Business is not a machine, it is groups of people working together to achieve something.</p>
<p>LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner says “interpersonal skills are where we’re seeing the biggest imbalance. Communications is the number one skills gap”. LinkedIn’s 2018 Workforce Report found that the four most in-demand soft skills are leadership, communication, collaboration, and time management. </p>
<p>Soft skills can be very hard to learn since it required an internal mind change. There is some debate about the importance of soft skills and hard skills that affect work or life. However, they are both necessary and equivalent to one another.</p>
<p>Soft skills often provide the foundation for high emotional intelligence (EQ). EQ is the ability to identify and manage our emotions, and also the ability to understand one’s emotions. When Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is related to technical skills, EQ accounts for 90% of what makes people move up the success ladder.</p>
<p>Mind-body awareness is an important soft skill. It helps us from reading the room and reading others before we are consciously aware of them. Mind-body practices such as yoga and meditation help us monitor ourselves and understand our mind. This kind of self-awareness also increases empathy. Empathy is useful in work or life. Think the way of others, put ourselves in one’s shoes, help us understand more in the circumstance, and control our emotions. Such habits allow us to engage more deeply with other people.</p>
<p>Focus on improving soft skills such as listening and empathy with a growth mindset that will bring us an unfair advantage in work and life.</p>

            <p>A high-income skill is a skill that you be able to leverage to get more paid. It’s often a soft skill than a hard skill. Like communication, passion, or reliability. It delivers a unique value to your organization and allows you to control your salary because you will be in high demand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your income right now is a result of your standards, it is not the industry, it is not the economy. - Tony Robbins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don’t always achieve your goals but you always improve your standard by doing it. To develop high-income skills, you need to increase your confidence with body language and communicate in the same ways as high earners. From the organization to the family, unclear communication can mess up everything. High-income earners consistently rate clear communication as an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>People who earn a high income drives every decision with their passion. When we living our life with passion, we living life instead of working a job.  We can find meaning in our work instead of just looking for the salary. A job can be a larger life strategy. High earners plan on how to leverage the existing resources they currently have to generate more income, this is the most powerful high-income skill.</p>
<p>Believe in the impossible is simply telling ourselves we can do it. At the end of the day, we won’t try the impossible if we don’t think there is a chance of success. In every moment, imagine that you are a high earner, what will you do in the current situation, learn a new skill to solve the problem if necessary. </p>
<p>As Tony Robbins said, “Who you spend time with is who you become.” Surround ourselves with the right people is the most important thing. A negative environment can’t make us think positive. Successful people know the power of networking, they surround themselves with people they wanted to become. Find people who achieved what we want, figure out how they did it, and modeling them. </p>
